"""Crossed composition/local-pattern/profile control sets on the frozen Readout cohort.

The Readout diagnostic asks whether a frozen representation adds predictive
information beyond one control set (profile scalar, likelihood scalar and 444
sequence descriptors). This module builds the nested control sets that the
information-hierarchy design pre-registers instead -- composition C, C plus
declared short-range patterns L, C plus mutation-local profile statistics P, and
C+L+P -- and reports the paired likelihood and representation increments over
each of them separately.

Every estimation decision is imported from the admitted Readout recipe:
:func:`~.readout_analysis.sequence_features` supplies C unchanged,
:func:`~.readout_analysis.nested_predict` supplies the nested held-group folds,
equal group/assay/variant weights, training-only weighted feature scaling and
the inner rank-mean-squared-error ridge selection, and
:func:`~.profile_increment.summarize` supplies the group-bootstrap intervals.
Nothing here refits, reorders or reweights those choices.

Two blocks are compressed, because a linear readout of a 8,000-coordinate
tripeptide difference is not affordable at the admitted fold and bootstrap
budget. The compression is the device the Readout protocol already declares for
the representation blocks: a fixed seeded Gaussian projection that depends only
on the target width and the recorded seed, never on labels or observed vectors.
A null increment under a projected block bounds that projected readout class and
does not establish that the uncompressed block carries no information.

The tokenisation block T is not a level of biological organisation. It is the
interface descriptor set the design requires so that a representation increment
cannot be attributed to segmentation without being seen: per-state token counts,
the token-count cycle that shifts every downstream position, and the number of
tokens whose segmentation changes between the two states.
