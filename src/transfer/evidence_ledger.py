"""One machine-readable table of every quantity the Direction-1 manuscript cites.

A quantity enters the table only by being read out of a file on disk: an admitted
analysis artifact, or --- where no artifact is retained locally --- a per-gate
record document. Nothing is typed in by hand except the locator (path, pointer,
and the semantic fields the artifact does not carry: support description, level,
verdict). A locator that does not resolve produces a recorded gap and no row, so
a quantity the manuscript needs and no file supports is absent and reported
rather than filled in.

The refusals enforced here are table-level conditions that must always hold:
every quantity carries a unit; every interval carries its resampling unit and
draw count; an estimate without an interval carries the reason it has none; an
effective (Kish) count carries the weighting convention it was computed under;
and every verdict comes from the four-outcome vocabulary, which never merges
``unresolved`` with ``not_detected``.
