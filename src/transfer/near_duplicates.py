"""The unit of independence in a corpus is not the record.

Why this module exists
======================

A stage that fits a map on one split and reports it on another needs the two
splits to be *independent*, and it usually enforces that by checking that no
record appears on both sides. On a web corpus that check is the whole of the
property. On a protein corpus it is a small part of it, and the gap was measured
rather than argued.

Swiss-Prot is non-redundant at the level of the *entry* -- one entry per protein
per organism -- and not at the level of the *sequence*. In the 10,240-record pool
``scripts/transfer/25_model_diffing_baselines.py`` draws in band 32-507 at skip
0, 1,289 records are byte-identical to another record of the same pool: the
acyl carrier protein ``acpP`` appears 41 times, once for each sequenced
enterobacterial strain, byte for byte. The exact-string check therefore fires,
and the stage refuses -- which is correct, and which no skip offset repairs
(distinct fraction 0.874, 0.865, 0.879, 0.854, 0.905 at skips 0, 4,096, 10,240,
20,480, 40,960).

The number that decides the design is the next one. Deduplicating the pool would
let the check pass while leaving most of the leakage in place: on the same pool,
searched with DIAMOND at ``--masking 0 --very-sensitive``, **41.4% of the
held-out records have a relative in the training split at 95% or higher identity
over the shorter sequence, and only 17.4% are exact**. Removing exact duplicates
removes at most the second number. A map fitted on the training positions would
still be reported on positions whose sequence it has effectively already seen,
and the bias is not symmetric between the two pairings the stage reports: the
shuffled-pairing null destroys position correspondence, so homology leakage
inflates the true-pairing fit alone and widens the gap that decides whether a
Crosscoder is warranted.

Drawing from a corpus whose redundancy is already controlled helps and does not
finish the job. The same measurement on a UniRef50 pool of the same size and
band gives zero exact duplicates at all five skips and a median maximum identity
of 10.3% -- but still 36 of 2,048 held-out records at 95% or higher and 4 at
100%, because UniRef50's clustering bounds the distance from a member to its own
representative and not the distance between two representatives. The corpus
choice moves the leakage by a factor of twenty; only splitting at the level of
the near-duplicate group removes it.

What is grouped, and what is deliberately not
=============================================

The relation is **near-duplication**, not homology. Two records are joined when
one's shingles are largely contained in the other's; groups are the connected
components. Remote and even close homologues stay free to fall on opposite sides
of the split, and the residual is measured and reported rather than gated.

That boundary is where it is because of this programme's own rule that no gate is
applied to a protein arm until it is shown attainable on the text control under
the same procedure. A near-duplicate gate is attainable on text: on the
10,240-document OpenWebText pool the completed text-mode cell used, no document
pair reaches containment 0.5, the largest word-13-gram containment of any
held-out document in the whole training side is 0.336, and 92.7% of held-out
documents share not one 13-gram with it. A *homology* gate has no text analogue
at all -- there is no such thing as a remote homologue of a web page -- so gating
remote homology would make the two modes incomparable in the opposite direction,
by holding the protein side to a criterion the text side is not even defined
under.

The instrument, and how its threshold was calibrated
====================================================

Containment of shingle sets, ``|A & B| / min(|A|, |B|)``, and not Jaccard.
Jaccard was tried first because :func:`src.transfer.relational.kmer_set` and
:func:`src.transfer.families.boundary_leakage` already use it, and it fails here:
it penalises length asymmetry, which is exactly the shape a short protein
contained in a longer one has. Against DIAMOND identity over the shorter
sequence on 60,000 aligned pairs from the two pools above, no Jaccard threshold
separates the classes -- at k=5 the best operating point still misses 1.3% of the
protein pool's near-duplicate pairs and 11.3% of UniRef50's, and the miss rate
rises to 55% at threshold 0.7.

Containment separates them completely. At :data:`RESIDUE_SHINGLE` = 5 the
*minimum* containment over every DIAMOND pair at 95% identity or above is 0.732
on the Swiss-Prot pool and 0.742 on the UniRef50 pool, while the 99th percentile
over all pairs below 95% is 0.754 and 0.438. Every threshold in 0.3-0.7
therefore misses none of them on either corpus, which is what
:data:`NEAR_DUPLICATE_CONTAINMENT` sits in the middle of: the ordering is
invariant across the sweep, so the threshold is a declared choice inside a flat
region rather than a tuned one. What it costs is over-merging, which is the safe
direction -- at 0.5, 4.9% of the sub-95% pairs are joined as well, so some close
homologues are kept together on one side that need not have been.

The calibration is complete for the class it covers: a pair DIAMOND does not
align at ``--evalue 1e-3`` is not a 95%-identity pair, so it cannot be a miss
this instrument is responsible for.

Alignment-free on purpose. The grouping runs inside a stage, on a compute node
where no aligner is staged and where nothing may be installed, so it is built
from shingle sets and an inverted index alone; DIAMOND appears here only as the
external standard the threshold was calibrated against, once, offline.

Not to be confused with :mod:`.families`, which partitions a cohort by
*externally curated* family labels so that a method can be said to generalise to
an unseen family. That is a different and stricter property, it needs a label
table keyed on accession, and it is not available for a raw corpus stream whose
records arrive without accessions. This module answers the narrower question a
fit/held-out split has to answer first.
