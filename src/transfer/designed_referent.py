"""Phenotype prediction on proteins the corpus does not contain.

Why this module exists
======================

F10 bounds what a protein decoder knows about function *relative to a lookup of
its own corpus*, and it cannot do better than bound it: every natural protein has
homologues in UniRef50, so over 187 ProteinGym wild types the least homologous is
still 55.5% identical to a cluster the model was trained on (EXP-R2-189).
Retrieval could be estimated and subtracted; it could never be excluded.

EXP-R2-190 staged a referent where it is excluded by construction. 132 of the 148
de novo designs in Tsuboyama et al. 2023 return **no** DIAMOND hit against the
60.3 M-cluster staged UniRef50 at the gate F10's homology control runs, against a
within-cohort natural control from the same file, the same assay and matched
length that hits at 328 of 330. This module is the measurement that referent was
staged for: the same zero-shot phenotype estimand F10 uses, run on designs where
retrieval is excluded and on the natural domains beside them where it is not.

What the estimand is, and what it is not
========================================

Per wild type, the Spearman correlation between an arm's summed log-likelihood of
a variant and that variant's measured stability (``ddG_ML``, the column
ProteinGym itself publishes as ``DMS_score`` for its 64 Tsuboyama assays -- the
two agree to 9e-16 on every shared variant). Per-wild-type correlations are
averaged inside a unit and the unit is resampled.

This is a **sequence-likelihood** estimand, so L31 does not bind it: a likelihood
needs no token alignment between the variant and the wild type, and the
multi-residue-BPE selection effect that makes position-level interventions
undefined on part of a ProtGPT2 cohort has no purchase here.

**A homologue-free referent is not an information-free one.** DIAMOND finding no
alignment says nothing about whether a design is built from *fragments* the
corpus is full of, and a decoder does not need to have seen a sequence to score
it above chance. So the baseline that replaces F10's profile LOOKUP -- empty by
construction on a disjoint referent -- has to be fragment-level, and it is built
here from the corrected corpus k-mer background as a proper conditional sequence
model rather than as a heuristic.

Identification is not uniform across the arms
=============================================

ProtGPT2's declared pretraining corpus **is** the staged UniRef50, so on that arm
alone the exclusion is *identified*: absence from the searched snapshot implies
absence from the 17%-smaller 2021_04 release it was trained on. Every ProGen2
rung saw UniRef90 and BFD30, and **BFD30 is not staged and was not searched**, so
a design absent from UniRef50 may still be in the corpus those arms read. That
asymmetry runs in the direction that flatters the model and is recorded in
:data:`ARM_IDENTIFICATION` beside every arm it applies to, so a ProGen2 number
cannot borrow ProtGPT2's certificate.

# ------------------------------------------- the higher-order fragment channel
#

# survives the exclusion of retrieval, and it rests entirely on the two channels
# above: maximum-likelihood conditionals at k = 3 and k = 4. A 3-mer or 4-mer
# Markov model is a weak model of corpus statistics, so that half is only worth
# what the strongest fragment channel the corpus supports is worth. Everything
# below builds that channel.
#
# Two things have to be right for it to be a fair test rather than a rigged one.
# A higher-order conditional cannot be maximum-likelihood: 20 letters give 3.2 M
# possible 5-mers and 64 M possible 6-mers, unobserved ones exist at those orders
# even in a 17 G-residue corpus, and an unobserved k-mer under maximum likelihood
# is a log-likelihood of minus infinity. So the channel needs a smoothing scheme,
# and the scheme changes its strength. It is *declared* rather than tuned: two
# parameter-free schemes, both reported. And past some order the conditional
# stops being estimated and starts being a lookup of the corpus itself, which
# would make the model look good for the wrong reason; where that happens is a
# measurement (held-out cross-entropy on natural sequence held out of the count)
# and not a matter of taste.

#: The two declared smoothing schemes. Both are parameter-free given the corpus,
#: which is what makes "declared, not tuned" enforceable: neither has a knob that
#: could be moved after a result is seen.

#:                  continuations of the context and ``N(c)`` its total count.
