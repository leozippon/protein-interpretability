"""Measured stability on metagenome-assembled domains, banded by retrieval identity.

This module owns the remote-homology gate's endpoint, its label-blind support
rules, its identity strata and its self-calibrating comparison. It exists because
every cohort the capability map has measured so far is saturated with
high-identity units: the stability gate's 101 one-per-group wild types carry no
alignment-detectable residual family structure at all, and the retrieval gate
reaches 1, 2 and 12 groups in its three lower identity bands against an
eight-unit percentile floor. Cho and Tsuboyama 2026's MGnify-derived libraries
populate the bands nothing else does.

The target is

    e = deltaG(variant) - deltaG(background),

the variant's own effect on folding free energy in kcal/mol on the staged table's
combined ``deltaG`` column, inferred jointly from the trypsin and chymotrypsin
channels. Larger deltaG is more stable, so a destabilising substitution gives a
negative e. That is the same two-estimate difference and the same sign convention
the admitted folding-and-stability gate measures on Tsuboyama 2023, so the two
are commensurable quantities on two sources.

**What this endpoint does not license.** It shares the cDNA-display proteolysis
assay technology and an author with Tsuboyama 2023, so it is not external
confirmation of anything and may not be read as independent replication; the
frozen endpoint qualification records that boundary and this module does not
widen it. An identity band is a property of a search against one UniRef50
snapshot: no detected alignment is not absence from any model's pretraining
corpus.

**The design constraint that decides whether this gate is interpretable.** The
two protease channels of this table disagree far more than they do on the
admitted MegaScale endpoint. Over 1,413,334 admitted rows the trypsin-minus-
chymotrypsin deltaG has mean -0.478 and root-mean-square 0.824 kcal/mol against a
combined-deltaG spread of 1.251, with Pearson r = 0.857: a level-scale floor two
thirds of the endpoint's own variation, and a systematic offset rather than
symmetric noise. The MegaScale endpoint's per-channel discordance is 0.2337
[0.2209, 0.2458] kcal/mol against a shared component of 0.9013. Two consequences
are declared here rather than discovered.

* The mean offset is common to a variant and to its own background, so it
  cancels in the difference this endpoint takes. The floor that bounds this gate
  is therefore the *effect-scale* discordance, measured on this gate's own
  admitted support by :func:`channel_decomposition`, and never the level-scale
  number. Both are reported, and which one a statement rests on is named.
* Whatever that floor turns out to be, a remote null is uninterpretable on its
  own. The comparison is **self-calibrating**: the same fit, on the same folds,
  is read out separately on the groups whose every member retrieves a close
  relative and on the groups whose every member does not, and the two readouts
  together select one of three outcomes -- :data:`OUTCOME_SURVIVES`,
  :data:`OUTCOME_HOMOLOGY_DEPENDENT` or :data:`OUTCOME_UNRESOLVED`. A remote
  result is never reported without naming which.

Weighting, folds, the ridge recipe, the projection, the nonlinear response and
the group bootstrap are imported from the external-confirmation and admitted
Readout recipes rather than restated, and every feature block is imported from
the stability gate. The independent unit is the family group; inside a group each
background carries equal weight, inside a background each mutated site, and
inside a site each variant.
