"""Prespecified retrieval and memorization strata, and stratified re-estimation.

The gate this module serves asks one question: does a model-side gain established
on a held-group split survive being read separately on units whose nearest
retrieved homolog is close and on units whose nearest retrieved homolog is
remote? A gain that concentrates where retrieval support is dense and vanishes
where it is thin is a retrieval explanation of that gain; a gain that holds flat
across strata is not explained that way.

No band edge here is a free parameter, because a free parameter on a stratum
boundary is a place where an outcome could enter the design.

* Identity bands are :data:`~.homology.STRATUM_NAMES` with
  :data:`~.homology.STRATUM_EDGES`, frozen in that module before its first
  search and imported rather than restated. Near-duplicate presence is the same
  declaration's top edge, 95.0% identity over the query.
* Depth bands are decades of the reweighted alignment depth ``Neff`` that both
  cohorts' profile stores already retain under identical settings, plus one
  explicit band for a unit whose search returns no qualifying homolog at all.
  The coarse two-level depth contrast splits at the same 100-effective-sequence
  decade and exists because a decade band can fall below the package's
  eight-unit percentile-interval floor.
* Family bands are read off the frozen grouping contract of each cohort: a unit
  whose group holds one member is in the remote band, a unit whose group holds
  more than one is in the close band. Nothing is re-clustered here.

Stratum assignment is a function of retrieved-homolog statistics and frozen
group membership only. No measured stability, DMS effect or fitted prediction
reaches it, so a stratum cannot be a function of the gain it is used to read.

Re-estimation reuses the estimator of the study it reads rather than restating
it: a stratum's estimate is the same paired statistic over the same fitted
held-out predictions, taken over the subset of resampling units the stratum
holds. Unit-level weighting inside a retained unit is therefore untouched, and
the full-support estimate is the unit-count-weighted mean of its strata, which
:func:`decomposition_residual` checks rather than assumes.
