"""Refit a gate's representation cells at a selected readout class and depth.

Every representation-level verdict in the capability map is provisional until the
readout reassessment completes, after which the representation analyses at every
gate are revisited and recomputed. This module is that recomputation: given the
reassessment's selected readout class and depth per arm, it refits a published
cell on **identical** support, folds, seeds, weighting and label budget, and
reports the recomputed increment beside the published one with both intervals
and the resampling unit.

Three properties make the refit a recomputation of the published quantity rather
than a new measurement, and each is enforced rather than assumed.

**Identity, or a refusal.** :func:`refuse_on_drift` compares the realised cell
against the published one on the ordered support, the unit and variant counts,
the split seed, every outer fold's held-unit membership, every inner fold's
membership, the resampling contract and the label budget. Any difference raises:
an increment measured on a support the published one did not use is not a
recomputation of it, and reporting the two side by side would invite exactly
that reading.

**A pinned reduction order.** The compressed representation block is a float32
matrix product, and a float32 product is not invariant to how the BLAS library
splits its reduction. The admitted analysis formed it under four threads; at
forty-eight the held-out predictions moved by up to 9.085e-07 against a 1e-8
gate while the endpoints stayed bit-identical. The thread count is therefore part
of pipeline identity, is pinned through
:func:`~src.transfer.readout_class_sweep.projected_block`, and a process with no
discoverable BLAS pool is refused rather than run unpinned.

**Rows blocked by assay.** The admitted analysis forms that product one assay at
a time. Forming it over a whole panel departs by up to 7.629e-06 in absolute
value at every thread count, which reached 3.483e-08 in the held-out predictions,
above the same gate. The product is therefore blocked by assay through
:func:`~src.transfer.readout_depth.admitted_design`, and
:func:`product_blocking_departure` measures the departure on the arrays at hand
so the constraint is a number in the report rather than a claim in a comment.

The module introduces no resampler: every interval it reports comes from the
resampler the published cell used, at that cell's own draws, seed and unit.
