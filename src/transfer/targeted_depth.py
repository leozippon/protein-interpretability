"""A targeted three-depth extraction for the two gates that cannot resolve depth.

The representation extractions of the folding-and-stability gate and the
residue-interaction gate each hooked exactly two blocks -- ``(L-1)//2`` and
``L-1`` -- on their own cohorts, so no other block's state was ever written for
either. A readout reassessment that selects a depth other than those two can be
applied to neither, and their representation verdicts are therefore conditional
on the admitted depth choice rather than on depth generally (audit L53).

This module plans the smallest extraction that removes that conditionality: at
each arm's **selected** depth, plus the two admitted depths retained alongside so
the new cells are comparable with the published ones on the same arrays. Three
depths per arm, not a full stack. The depth sweep's own measurement is what makes
that affordable -- capturing more blocks costs the same single forward pass per
sequence, and the additional cost is storage and fitting rather than inference --
so the GPU estimate below is the *measured* wall clock of the extraction that
already ran on each cohort, and the storage estimate is the only quantity that
grows with the number of depths.

Nothing here dispatches. The plan is parameterised on the reassessment's own
per-arm selection and refuses without it. Whether its lanes are queueable is read
from each extractor's own source rather than assumed: both now accept the
repeatable depth option, so the lanes parse, and the check stays because the same
wave whose numbers this module quotes lost three of its four first cells to
argparse for naming an option its snapshot did not define.
