"""Mutation-order census and complete-cube support over ProteinGym substitution assays.

No model score, likelihood or representation enters anything here. The contrast
itself is :func:`src.transfer.higher_order_cycle.cycle_contrast`, reused rather
than reimplemented; this module supplies the ProteinGym-specific parts: the
``mutant`` column's grammar, the per-assay measured-state keys, and the
lower-order completeness requirement that decides which variants carry a cycle.

ProteinGym substitution CSVs carry no exact wild-type row, so corner ``()`` of
every cube is unmeasured. The wild-type value is an assay constant and enters a
cycle contrast of any order with coefficient ``(-1) ** order``, so it shifts
every contrast in one assay by the same amount and cancels from within-assay
ranks or centred residuals. That is the estimand this support admits; it does
not identify absolute sign or magnitude and does not remove assay nonlinearity.
Accordingly the completeness requirement below asks for every non-empty subset
of a variant's substitutions and treats the empty corner as the assay constant.
