"""What a transfer measurement scores: which depth, which window, which targets.

Four decisions sit upstream of every number this programme reports, and each is
declared exactly once here:

``analysis_layer`` / ``analysis_layers``
    the absolute layer a *relative depth* names on an arm of a given size;
``source_layers_for_target``
    the layers a window of a given width spans, ending at a target layer;
``target_rule`` / ``sequence_target_mask``
    which next-token positions belong to the cohort rather than to the prompt;
``per_sequence_scores`` / ``aggregate_variant``
    how those positions turn into a cross-entropy, a KL and an agreement rate.

Two of these were duplicated before EXP-R2-066, and both duplicates disagreed
with their originals.

**Depth.** ``src/transfer/relational.py`` carried a second depth conversion,
``int(round(fraction * (n_layer - 1)))``. Python's ``round`` is banker's
rounding, so at an exact half it goes to the *even* neighbour while
:func:`analysis_layer`'s ``floor(x + 0.5)`` goes up. On this panel they disagree
for exactly one cell -- the 27-layer ProGen2 arms at relative depth 0.25, where
``0.25 * 26 = 6.5`` is exact in binary: ``analysis_layer`` says layer 7 and the
duplicate said layer 6. ``09_probe_and_erasure.py`` reached the duplicate and
``02``, ``03`` and ``08`` reached the original, so two stages of one campaign
disagreed about what depth 0.25 meant on the two protein arms carrying the
protein-side corpus contrast. See the EXP-R2-066 log entry for the blast radius.

**Targets.** :func:`sequence_target_mask` used to dispatch on the arm's *name*:
it stripped a conditioning prompt for the literal string ``"zymctrl"`` and, for
every other name, discarded the boundary token ids it was handed without a word.
An EC-conditioned arm named anything else would have had its EC tag, separator
and terminator scored as cohort content -- the positions the model predicts most
confidently -- which lowers clean cross-entropy and raises context information,
with no exception anywhere. ``src/transfer/budget.py`` carried a guard against
that (``require_boundary_masking_support``), and ``src/transfer/probes.py``
worked around it by synthesising fake names (``f"{arm.name}_plain"``) to select a
rule. The rule is now a parameter, derived from ``ArmSpec.input_format``, so the
guard and the fake names are both gone and a second EC-conditioned arm is handled
correctly by construction rather than refused by an allow-list.

One negative control lives here too, because it is defined entirely in terms of
those targets. :class:`TargetTokenShuffle` permutes exactly the positions
:func:`sequence_target_mask` selects and nothing else, which leaves each record's
target multiset -- and so any unigram baseline taken over it -- exactly
unchanged. It is never applied unless a caller asks for it by name.

Vendored from ``src/revision/dictionary_fidelity.py``, whose remaining contents
(windowed-transcoder encode/decode, checkpoint identity, the frozen fidelity
spec) served the retired CLT / dictionary-qualification scope.

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class TargetTokenShuffle:
    """A seeded within-record permutation of exactly the scored target positions.

    E3 of ``docs/CONTEXT_INFORMATION_UNCERTAINTY_PREREGISTRATION.md`` asks for an
    arm whose true context information is known to be small, because neither the
    0.30 nats/token floor nor the sign criterion has ever been exercised near its
    boundary: the panel jumps from -4.08 nats on ``dialogpt-small`` to +1.06 on
    ``progen2-base`` with nothing in between. Permuting a record's target tokens
    destroys the sequential structure a model could read while leaving that
    record's target multiset untouched, so ``H_baseline`` -- a unigram
    cross-entropy over exactly those targets -- is unchanged to the last bit and
    only ``H_model`` moves.

    **Which positions move.** Exactly the positions :func:`sequence_target_mask`
    scores, and nothing else. Column ``q`` of that mask governs the prediction of
    input token ``q + 1``, so the permuted set is ``{q + 1 : mask[q]}``: under
    ``all_valid`` every real token except the first, and under
    ``between_boundaries`` the span strictly between ``<start>`` and ``<end>``.
    The first token of a plain rendering, an EC-conditioned rendering's tag,
    ``<sep>`` and both boundary markers, and every padding position therefore
    stay where they are. Two consequences are the whole point: the per-record
    target multiset is invariant, and the mask recomputed after the permutation
    selects the identical positions, because nothing it reads has moved. No token
    crosses a boundary in either direction.

    **One quantity downstream of the multiset is nonetheless not bit-invariant.**
    A per-symbol conversion counts the *characters* the scored ids decode to, and
    a byte-level BPE can split one multi-byte character across two tokens: reorder
    them and those bytes no longer form that character, so the decoder emits
    replacement characters instead. Measured on gpt2 over 24 OpenWebText records,
    ``symbols_per_token`` moves from 4.4699 to 4.4831 -- three parts in a
    thousand -- and every ``*_bits_per_symbol`` field moves with it. Residue-level
    arms and ProtGPT2 are unaffected, since their pieces decode to whole ASCII
    characters, and no nats-per-token figure is touched on any arm.

    **Where it is applied.** After truncation to ``max_len`` and after padding,
    in :func:`src.transfer.arms.tokenize_batch`. Permuting before truncation
    would change *which* tokens survive the window and therefore the multiset,
    which is the one thing this control may not do.

    **Reproducibility.** ``seed`` is the run's declared seed; the permutation of
    one record is drawn from it combined with a digest of that record's own
    unpadded token ids. It therefore does not depend on the batch size, on the
    record's position in the cohort, or on the padding width it was batched with,
    and re-running at the same seed reproduces every permutation. Two records
    with identical token ids receive identical permutations, which is what
    keying by content means.

    **What this control establishes, and what it does not.** It bounds what a
    predictor with no usable sequential context achieves *on shuffled input*.
    That is not the same thing as a model whose true context information is zero.
    Shuffled text is off the training distribution in ways beyond the loss of
    context, so what the model produces at a scored position is not its marginal
    token distribution: it can be worse than a held-out unigram, which reads as a
    negative context information of no fixed size, and it is not guaranteed to
    land near the floor the criteria are being tested against. The control's
    value is that the criteria and the bootstrap are then exercised at whatever
    value it does land on, instead of four nats from any boundary; the value
    itself must be read as a measurement of this control and not as a zero. It is
    also silent about the smoothing bias recorded separately in the
    pre-registration: a genuinely context-free predictor still reads a positive
    ``I`` of order ``log(1 + alpha V / R)``.
