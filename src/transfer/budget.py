"""Stage-1 substrate measurement: is an evaluation cohort measurable at all?

Every normalised interpretability score - loss recovered, KL recovered, a
mutual-information gate - is a ratio whose denominator is the information the
model actually commits on the cohort relative to a context-free baseline. If
that denominator is small the ratio is noise; if it is negative the arm is
off-distribution and the ratio is meaningless.

The motivating history is worth stating precisely, because the first version of
this docstring quoted figures that were themselves measurement artefacts and
have since been retracted. What actually happened: a production qualification on
a 64-246 residue EC-labelled cohort appeared to show ProGen2-medium starved at
0.099 nats/token and ProtGPT2 off-distribution at -1.73 nats/token. Neither
survived. The ProGen2 figure came from comparing against a *different* cohort
(plain rather than EC-labelled Swiss-Prot); its true value there is 1.24-1.52.
The ProtGPT2 figure came from rendering it as one unwrapped line when it was
pretrained on FASTA-formatted UniRef50, worth 1.42 nats/token; measured across
four cohorts under the correct rendering it is +0.21 to +3.89 and has never
reproduced as negative.

The lesson is not that the power check is unnecessary - it is that the power
check must be applied to a cohort the arm is actually native to, and with an
unbiased baseline. A plug-in unigram estimate computed on the scored tokens
understates entropy by 0.75 nats for a 50k-vocabulary text arm and 1.65 nats for
a 50k-vocabulary protein arm while leaving residue-level arms untouched, which
inflates every share computed from it by up to 74 per cent.

This module measures that power figure *before* any scientific gate is applied
so that a starved arm is reported as unmeasurable on the cohort rather than as
a failed scientific hypothesis.

Identifying an arm and admitting its reading as a denominator are two criteria,
and this module declares both. They were one undeclared 0.30-nat constant until
EXP-R2-218 calibrated each against a known-zero null family and a known-signal
mixing family, and they turned out to have different answers by more than an
order of magnitude. **Neither is a constant now.** Identification is
:func:`context_identification` -- the arm's displacement-corrected 95% interval
must lie strictly above zero -- and a bounded ratio needs the reading to sit
:data:`FIELLER_DENOMINATOR_MULTIPLE` of its own standard errors above zero, which
is 0.146 to 0.966 nats depending on the arm. Both read the arm's own precision,
so they are nested with the ratio criterion strictly the stronger, and the pair
of readings that a magnitude rule and a precision rule ordered oppositely
(EXP-R2-220) cannot recur.

Two constants survive as reporting columns. :data:`MIN_CONTEXT_INFORMATION_NATS`
decides nothing anywhere. :data:`SCREENING_CONTEXT_INFORMATION_NATS` decides
nothing where an interval exists and remains the *pre-interval screen* upstream
of the bootstrap, where no interval does -- :func:`arm_power` among them, since
it is the function that produces the statistics the interval is later computed
from. A verdict taken there is a screen and says so.

Per-token quantities are tokenizer-dependent and are therefore not comparable
across arms: ProtGPT2 uses multi-residue BPE while ZymCTRL and ProGen2-medium
are residue-level. The held-out residue Markov ladder is the only
tokenizer-independent axis on which the protein arms can be compared to each
other, so it is reported alongside every per-token figure.

#: Context information an arm must read before a stage that has no interval will
#: score it at all.
#:
#: **This stopped being the identification criterion at EXP-R2-221.** It is a
#: *pre-interval screen*: a magnitude comparison that a stage upstream of any
#: bootstrap can make, and the only thing such a stage can make. Identification
#: itself is :func:`context_identification`, which reads the arm's own
#: displacement-corrected interval and needs no constant at all. Where an
#: interval exists this constant decides nothing and is reported for
#: comparability; where none exists the verdict taken from it is a screen and the
#: artefact says so rather than calling it identification.
#:
#: **What the demotion cost the constant, measured.** As an identification rule a
#: fixed magnitude orders two readings by size while their own standard errors
#: order them the other way, and EXP-R2-220 found the first real pair on which
#: that happens: ``galactica-1.3b``'s protein mode reads +0.047678 at
#: SE 0.004571 -- 10.43 standard errors from zero and admissible as a ratio
#: denominator -- and this floor refuses it by 0.0023 nats, while
#: ``Llama-2-7b-hf``'s protein mode passes at +0.084287 and is refused by the
#: Fieller condition at 8.28. One of those refusals is a false negative and the
#: other is not, and no value of a constant separates them (EXP-R2-221, §5.10).
#:
#: The derivation below is what it was and is retained: it is why this remains an
#: adequate *screen* even though it is not the identification criterion.
#:
#: Derived at EXP-R2-218 against a known-zero null family (the independent-block
#: unigram control) and a known-signal lambda family, 1920 readings over 15 arms
#: and 24 cohort draws. On the point rule ``I_hat >= tau`` the false-positive
#: rate first reaches 0.05 at ``tau = 0.010`` and is exactly zero from
#: ``tau = 0.015`` upward; the largest null point departure anywhere was 0.0132
#: nats. 0.05 is adopted rather than 0.010 or 0.015 for three reasons: it keeps
#: a 3.8x margin over that largest observed null departure, it reaches 80% power
#: from a true ``I`` of about 0.05 on every arm of the panel, and it sits clear
#: of the smoothing and Jensen noise band -- the bootstrap displaces the null
#: interval upward by a mean of +0.0095 and a maximum of +0.0347 nats -- that
#: makes any threshold inside 0.010-0.020 indefensible in practice.
#:
#: **Cross-fitted at EXP-R2-219 and it holds; the 0.010 does not.** Re-deriving
#: the threshold on each calibration fold and scoring it on units the derivation
#: never saw -- 24 cohort draws, and separately seven tokenisation classes, the
#: 120 null cells being only 56 distinct measurements -- this floor admits 0 of
#: 120 held-out null readings under every scheme and no fold asks for more than
#: 0.015 nats. The calibrated 0.010 reaches a held-out rate of 0.0667 against its
#: own 0.05 target, because it is set by the single noisiest cohort draw. A rate
#: of zero is not proof: over 56 distinct measurements the one-sided 95% limit on
#: this floor's false-positive rate is 0.052, so it is validated as not too lax at
#: the resolution the panel supports and not as exact.
#:
#: **It changes no verdict on the current panel.** Every arm reads at or above
#: +0.90 nats (progen2-small, the lowest positive) or at or below -3.98 nats
#: (dialogpt-small), so the 15 arms fall on the same side of 0.05 as they fell of
#: the retired 0.30, and no held-out fold's threshold moves one either.
#:
#: The *uncorrected* interval variant ``lower bound >= tau`` was and remains the
#: weaker statistic near zero: 56 of 112 null lower bounds sit above zero before
#: any signal exists. What changed at EXP-R2-221 is that the displacement those
#: bounds were reading is now measured and removed, and the corrected variant at
#: ``tau = 0`` admits none of them -- which is why identification moved to
#: :func:`context_identification` and this constant did not follow it there.

#: (bygpt5-small) to 0.9664 (dialogpt-small), a spread of 6.6x, with 12 of the 15

#: that no record in ``results/`` landed between 0 and 0.30 -- which is agreement
#: in a region where nothing was at stake.
#:
#: Calibration measured both jobs and found it wrong in opposite directions. For
#: identification it is 20-30x stricter than the false-positive rate requires
#: (calibrated tau 0.010 at FPR 0.05, 0.015 at FPR 0). For ratio boundedness it
#: is up to 3.2x too lax: 12 of 15 arms need more than 0.30 standard-error-widths
#: of denominator, and a single constant sufficient for every arm would have to
#: be at least 0.97. In the other two units it is not one criterion at all --
#: rho 0.092 on byte arms, 0.040 on GPT-2 arms, 0.104 at residue level, 0.034 on

    and ``token_count`` reconstruct it and any resampling of it. The context-free

    scored cohort itself, ``"disjoint"`` evaluates a unigram model fitted on a
    held-out reference corpus, whose token-count vector and provenance the
    caller supplies. Both go through
    :func:`src.transfer.pathways.unigram_baseline`, so this function has no
    estimator dispatch of its own and there is no fallback: asking for the
    held-out estimator without a reference raises, because a silent downgrade
    would move every context-information figure without changing anything a
    reader can see.

    This used to be split across two files. ``arm_power`` computed everything
    against the plug-in and ``01_cohort_power.py`` recomputed *some* of it
    afterwards from a held-out cross-entropy of its own, which left the rest of
    the record normalised against the estimator that had been replaced. The
    published consequence: ZymCTRL carried
    ``context_information_miller_madow_nats`` 2.027 beside
    ``context_information_nats`` 2.029, two "context information" figures taken
    against different baselines with nothing in either name to say so.

    **How a field says which baseline it came from.** A name carrying
    ``plug_in``, ``on_cohort`` or ``miller_madow`` belongs to the in-cohort
    plug-in family and is computed against the plug-in whichever estimator was
    asked for. Every other baseline-derived field is computed against the
    estimator named in ``unigram_estimator``, published as a number in
    ``unigram_entropy_used_for_verdict_nats`` and with its full provenance in
    ``unigram_baseline``. The Miller-Madow variants are named
    ``*_plug_in_miller_madow_*`` rather than left bare because the correction
    ``(observed - 1) / 2N`` is a bias correction *for the plug-in entropy
    estimator*: it has no meaning applied to a held-out cross-entropy, so the
    honest form of the field is the plug-in one, named as such.

    The ``budget`` capability is required here rather than only at the stages
    that call this, because the line below reads ``config.vocab_size`` as the
    alphabet an entropy is taken over -- and that key is not the alphabet on
    every checkpoint this repository can load. ``progen2-large`` declares 51200
    against a 31-token tokenizer, so its plug-in entropy and its Miller-Madow
    correction would be taken over 51169 unreachable symbols; ``progen2-xlarge``
    declares no ``vocab_size`` at all and would raise here rather than at a
    declaration. Both are :data:`src.transfer.arms.STAGED_ARMS` members that
    withhold the ``budget`` capability for exactly this reason, and the refusal
    belongs where the key is read (Appendix B rule 12).

    The second return value is the per-record reduction of the same forward
    pass; see :class:`RecordStatistics` for why it is worth persisting.

    One array file for the whole stage, because one stage run is one cohort and
    one set of seeds; per-arm arrays are prefixed ``"<arm>::"`` since the
    vocabulary, the tokenisation and therefore every count differ by arm. The
    returned block is the artefact's own record of the file -- schema, name and
    digest -- and belongs in the report JSON, so that a reader learns from the
    report whether the sidecar exists and whether it is the one that was
    written. A companion JSON would be a second file free to drift from the
    first.

    Global entries: ``schema_version``, ``arms``, ``cohort_digest``,
    ``reference_digest`` (empty when the run used no reference), ``smoothing``
    (NaN when no reference, in which case no smoothing entered any figure),
    ``max_len``, ``seed_names`` and ``seed_values``. Per arm: ``vocab_size``,
    ``record_index``, ``clean_nll_sum``, ``token_count``, ``n_symbols``,
    ``counts_offsets``, ``unique_token_ids``, ``counts`` and -- when a reference
    was used -- ``reference_token_count``, ``reference_counts_offsets``,
    ``reference_unique_token_ids``, ``reference_counts``.

    No sequence text: the cohort JSON beside this file already holds every
    record, and a second copy under a different digest is a second source.
