"""The ProLLaMA training-stage lineage, and the one rendering all of it is read under.

**What this module is for.** ``20_retrieval_bound.py`` and ``29_designed_referent.py``
resolve an arm through :mod:`src.transfer.arms`, and a joint language-protein
checkpoint is not an arm: ``21_joint_mode_qualification.py``'s standing rule is
that a checkpoint which has not passed that stage "must not be in ``arms.py`` at
all", so there is nothing there for either stage to name. EXP-R2-226 needs those
two frozen protein-capability queues read on three checkpoints of one lineage,
so the checkpoints are declared here -- by directory, beside the rendering family
they take and the training stage each one is -- and the two stages reach them
through this one declaration rather than through two of their own.

**The lineage.** ``Llama-2-7b-hf`` -> ``ProLLaMA_Stage_1`` -> ``ProLLaMA``: an
unadapted text decoder, the same weights after LoRA continued pretraining on a
protein corpus with ``embed_tokens`` and ``lm_head`` retrained outright, and that
checkpoint after instruction tuning. Adjacent pairs are base-Stage 1 and
Stage 1-Stage 2. All three are ``LlamaForCausalLM``, 32 layers, width 4096,
vocabulary 32000, ``max_position_embeddings`` 4096, and their ``tokenizer.model``
files are byte-identical, so a rendered variant segments identically on all three
and a paired difference is formed on identical scored units.

**One rendering, and it is the unconditioned one.** All three rungs are scored
under the identical bare ``Seq=<...>`` block --
:meth:`src.transfer.joint_modes.JointRendering.render_protein` with no context,
which is a supported path and not a workaround. Stage 2's declared instruction
form ``[Generate by superfamily] Superfamily=<...>`` is deliberately not used:
supplying a true superfamily would put the assay's own family label into the
prompt, which is an L15-class conditioning leak on the very quantity being
measured, and fabricating one would put a false fact inside the measurement.
The asymmetry that creates is declared rather than hidden -- Stage 2 is measured
outside the format it was tuned for, so a Stage 2 reading at or below Stage 1's
is **not** evidence that instruction tuning removed a capability.

**What one scored symbol is.** This family declares the TOKEN as its symbol unit
(:mod:`src.transfer.joint_modes`): the unmodified LLaMA-2 SentencePiece
vocabulary merges residue runs and there is no escape that reaches a per-residue
alphabet, because the merged rendering *is* the trained format. So the summed
log-likelihood here is over merged multi-residue pieces, which is a different
scoring functional from the single-residue sum every panel protein arm is read
under. A magnitude from this lineage is not commensurable with a residue-unit
family's (Appendix B rule 26, limitation L23); the measured residues per scored
token is accumulated by the scorer and travels beside every magnitude.

**Why the loader is here and not borrowed.** ``21_joint_mode_qualification.py``
loads a joint checkpoint and reads its shape back off the built object, but it
does not expose Transformers' loading diagnostics, and EXP-R2-226's first
qualification clause is exactly that ``missing_keys``, ``unexpected_keys``,
``mismatched_keys`` and ``error_msgs`` are all empty -- a newly initialised head
is unavailable, never a pass (L24). :func:`load_rung` is therefore this
campaign's one declaration of how a rung reaches a card, used by its
qualification gate and by both fitness stages, so a scored rung and a qualified
rung cannot have been built differently.
