"""What each gate retained, and whether its representation cells can be refitted.

Every representation-level verdict in the capability map is provisional until the
readout reassessment completes, after which the representation analyses at every
gate are revisited and, where necessary, recomputed
(:doc:`docs/D1_CAPABILITY_MAP_PLAN.md`). A recomputation is cheap only where the
gate retained enough to refit without another forward pass, and that is a
property of what each gate's own extraction hooked rather than of how much disk
it used.

Two selection kinds are distinguished because they have different retention
requirements, and conflating them is the mistake this module exists to prevent:

``readout_class``
    A different function of the **two admitted extraction depths**' four pooled
    summaries -- a wider projection, the uncompressed features, a nonlinear
    head, or one depth-and-pooling block alone. A gate can serve this from its
    own retained full-width block outputs, with no forward pass anywhere.

``extraction_depth``
    Any block other than the two the admitted extraction hooked, or a
    position-resolved summary. No retained array holds those. A gate can serve
    this only if a depth-resolved extraction exists **on that gate's own
    cohort**; otherwise the recomputation needs a fresh extraction, which is a
    measurement campaign rather than a refit.

The declaration below is the single source for both the inventory report and the
recomputation driver's artefact resolution, so a location cannot drift between
the two. It records locations as the gate records state them, and a probe reports
which are present under which root: the substantive artefacts live on the remote
cluster, so "absent from this host" and "missing" are different findings and are
reported as such.
