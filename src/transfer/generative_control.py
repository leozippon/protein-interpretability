"""Matched statistical generators for the generation-and-control gate.

Why this module exists
======================

The generation gate asks whether a frozen decoder's *samples* satisfy a
biological requirement. Every existing generation endpoint in this programme
compares a generated sequence either against its own composition shuffle (the
structure contrast) or against another condition of the same arm (the requested
-minus-mismatched profile contrast). Neither answers the question a reader asks
first: **a generator that knows only the corpus's residue statistics would also
produce sequences a curated profile recognises -- how much of the endpoint is
that?**

Answering it needs generators, not scores. A baseline that ranks mutations
cannot be compared against a sampler, so the controls here are *generators*: each
one emits one sequence per attempt of the arm's own ledger, at that attempt's
exact length, carrying a declared and verifiable amount of sequence statistics
and nothing more. The declared amounts form one axis:

===============  ==========================================================
``shuffle``      the attempt's own residue multiset, order exact, order > 0
                 destroyed
``markov_k``     the corpus's ``(k+1)``-mer statistics, for k = 0, 2, 4
``fragment``     a contiguous substring of one corpus record -- every corpus
                 k-mer order at once, the limit of the ``markov_k`` axis
``hydropathy``   the corpus composition tilted to the attempt's own mean
                 Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy, and nothing else
``natural``      a whole corpus record in the attempt's length band, the
                 reference for what satisfying the requirement looks like
``profile``      sequences emitted from the oracle's own profiles: an
                 oracle-access ceiling, declared as such and never a control
                 the model is asked to beat
===============  ==========================================================

Competence before comparison
============================

The capability map binds every control with one rule: a control enters a
comparison only if it is competent in its own right. For a *predictor* that
means predicting held-out groups; for a *generator* it means reproducing the
order statistics it declares. :func:`qualify_cohort` measures that and returns a
receipt, and a cohort whose receipt does not pass licenses nothing -- the same
disposition the local-context gate's failed control receives.

The measurement here is deliberately not a model quantity. Which sequences a
profile recognises is an oracle output, so this module produces sequences and
receipts and leaves the oracle to the stage that runs it.
