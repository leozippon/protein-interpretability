"""Single-mutant stability gate: endpoint, label-blind support, declared controls.

The gate's question is whether a frozen model quantity places resolvable
information about how a single substitution changes measured folding stability,
beyond controls that are competent held-out predictors in their own right.

The endpoint is the single-mutant stability change

    ddG = y_mut - y_WT

on the combined MegaScale ``dG_ML`` scale in kcal/mol, with the source's sign
convention: ``dG_ML`` is an unfolding free energy, larger is more stable, so
``ddG < 0`` is destabilising. It is a two-estimate difference, not the four-estimate
cycle that ``pairwise_epistasis`` targets, so it carries its own between-protease
agreement, its own noise floor and its own support accounting; nothing in the
cycle endpoint's admission transfers to it.

Three support rules are declared here rather than discovered:

* Insertion and deletion constructs have their ``aa_seq`` truncated to the wild
  type's length in the pinned files, so keying a state on ``aa_seq`` alone lets
  an indel row masquerade as a substitution variant. Every row whose ``mut_type``
  begins ``ins`` or ``del`` is excluded, with its accounting reported.
* Censored ``dG_ML`` strings (``<-1``, ``>5``, ``-``) are never coerced to numeric
  endpoints; they are counted and dropped.
* One background per final family group, chosen by alphabetical ``WT_name``, and
  at most :data:`VARIANT_CAP` single mutants per background drawn by a stable hash
  of the mutant sequence. Neither rule inspects a measurement or a model score.

Weighting, folds, the ridge recipe, the projection and the group bootstrap are
imported from the admitted Readout and pairwise recipes rather than restated. The
independent unit is the family group; inside a group the mutated site carries the
weight and the variants of one site share it, because the substitutions at one
position probe one local environment and every variant of a background shares that
background's single wild-type measurement.
