"""The native conditioning interface, exercised as a capability rather than scored.

EXP-R2-227 (track D1.h). Every Direction-1 measurement before this one is a
*scoring* measurement -- a likelihood, a context information, a rank correlation.
Nothing in this programme had ever asked a generative model to generate. Two
panel-adjacent checkpoints carry a conditioning interface that was trained into
them and has never been exercised:

* **ZymCTRL's EC tag.** L15 prices it at 1.73 nats on the cohort it was measured
  on, so the tag demonstrably moves the distribution. **Nobody has asked whether
  it moves it in the requested direction.** A leak of that size is equally
  consistent with a tag that selects the right enzyme class and with a tag that
  shifts composition and length while selecting nothing, and the within-arm
  mismatched-label reference below is the one thing that separates them.
* **ProLLaMA Stage 2's superfamily instruction**, declared in
  :data:`src.transfer.joint_modes.JOINT_RENDERINGS` and never run.

**This is not the retired steering line, and this module says so before any
sequence exists.** Audit section 9.1 retires EC steering, the feature atlas and
the drug-design line, all of which concerned *internal-feature intervention* and
returned a measured 0/8 on significant positive EC classes across three separate
attempts. Nothing here injects a feature, a direction or a coefficient. The
intervention is **the prompt the model was trained to receive**, and the estimand
is behavioural. The retirement is untouched and is not reopened.

The estimand, per class *c* and per conditioned arm, is the rate ``p(c)`` at
which generations produced under the native request for *c* are assigned to *c*
by an external, non-neural oracle, judged against three references measured in
the same run on the same oracle: the within-arm **mismatched-label** negative,
the **unconditioned** floor at comparable scale, and the per-class **real-protein
anchor** that prices the instrument. Every one of those is what
:data:`CONDITIONS` enumerates, and the compound in :func:`compound_verdict` is
the only gate.

The prior generation numbers in this repository -- EXP-R2-013/014, unsteered
ZymCTRL lysozyme at Pfam 0.820 and CLEAN exact EC 0.775, n=200 -- are single
class, pre-discipline, with no near-duplicate grouping, no homology reporting and
no bootstrap. They are **attainability evidence only**: not a baseline, not a
comparison, and not a result this campaign reproduces or supersedes.
