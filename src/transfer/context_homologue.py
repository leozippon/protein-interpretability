"""In-context homologue conditioning in frozen, single-sequence-pretrained decoders.

EXP-R2-228, track D1.i. **The question is whether an in-context conditioning gain
exists at all in a decoder that never saw a homologue set during pretraining**,
measured against controls that separate evolutionary relatedness from in-context
copying, with the identical estimand run on a text decoder.

The hypothesis this module is built to defeat
=============================================

Kantroo, Wagner & Machta (arXiv:2504.17068, 2025) measure **ProGen2-M**, which is
this repository's ``progen2-medium``. Appending a copy of a sequence to itself
collapses its likelihood; the collapse also occurs for **random, non-natural**
sequences; it persists to **50% sequence divergence**; and it fires on needles as
small as **10 residues**. That is an induction/copying mechanism producing exactly
the signal an in-context homology experiment is designed to detect, for reasons
that have nothing to do with homology.

Copying is therefore the leading hypothesis, not one control among several, and
the whole control structure follows from it:

* **Identity band is the primary design factor.** Global identity demonstrably
  does not screen the mechanism, so it cannot be a covariate to adjust for; it is
  the axis. ``>= 90`` is excluded at construction, and the four remaining bands
  are measured separately.
* **A local-overlap screen sits underneath the identity band.** Every (target,
  context item) pair carries its longest common substring and its shared 7-mer
  count. A pair at or above :data:`HIGH_LOCAL_OVERLAP_LCS` never enters a primary
  context; those pairs are collected into their own stratum and **scored**, so the
  copying effect is measured rather than only excluded.
* **The decisive stratum is the bottom local-overlap tercile of the ``< 30``
  band**, where no long shared substring exists and global identity is minimal.
  Measured on the frozen pool, that stratum's longest common substrings sit at 4-6
  residues -- *below* Kantroo et al.'s 10-residue needle, which is the property
  clause 3 of the gate depends on.

What is fixed and what is an outcome
====================================

**The budget is tokens, not k.** For each target the context budget is the arm's
:data:`POSITION_BUDGET` positions minus that target's own rendered length. Items
are added under a frozen order until the budget is exhausted, so **k is an
outcome, reported per arm as a distribution**, and it is the *fraction of the
window one item consumes* that is matched across arms rather than the item count.

Within one target every condition is built to the **same k** and to the **same
per-item token lengths**, so the paired contrast holds position, length and item
count fixed and varies only content.

Endpoints
=========

Both primary endpoints are dimensionless and paired:

``auroc``
    Over units, the probability that a true-homologue context yields a lower
    target NLL than its own matched-unrelated context, ties at one half. A
    discrimination statistic with no unit and no denominator -- the one quantity
    here that is legitimately comparable across arms and across modalities, and,
    being task-shaped rather than loss-shaped, the endpoint Bertsch et al.'s
    "next-token loss keeps falling while capability plateaus" warning does not
    undermine.
``fractional_reduction``
    The paired homologue-minus-matched-unrelated difference divided by that
    arm's own position-only-context NLL. Dimensionless, within-arm, and the
    denominator travels with it in every record (Appendix B rule 27).

**ΔNLL in nats per scored token is a descriptive curve and nothing more.** It is
reported per arm beside that arm's measured symbols per token and is never
differenced across arms (L23, Appendix B rule 26).

**Never (k minus k = 0).** :data:`NO_CONTEXT` is scored because the
registration's own failure branch -- "the position-only control moves the target's
NLL as much as the homologue condition" -- cannot be checked without it, and for
no other reason. :func:`gate` refuses to read it, and every record carrying it is
labelled :data:`DIAGNOSTIC_NEVER_THE_EFFECT`.

The mono-shuffle, measured rather than assumed
=============================================

The registration asks for "mono-residue-shuffled homologues" whose composition is
preserved *exactly*, and separately for every control to be **token-length-matched
per arm**. On a residue-level tokeniser those are one operation. On ProtGPT2 they
are two, and three things were measured before the shuffle was written.

*A token-level shuffle is not an acceptable substitute on this arm.* ProtGPT2's
BPE pieces reach **32 residues** on natural Swiss-Prot sequences in the frozen
pool (median 3, 95th percentile 4). Permuting tokens would leave runs three times
Kantroo et al.'s 10-residue needle intact inside a single piece, which is exactly
the copying signal this control exists to destroy. So the protein shuffle is
residues, as the registration froze it, and the text shuffle is tokens, as the
registration froze it (:data:`SHUFFLE_UNITS`).

*A residue permutation costs a few per cent more tokens, with a heavy tail.* Over
300 pool records the rendered token count of a permutation is a median **1.027x**
the natural sequence's, 1.111x at the 90th percentile and up to 2x. Summed over a
k of up to 37 items that is a context tens to hundreds of tokens longer than the
homologue context it must match -- a control that varies length as well as
content.

*Most items admit a permutation of exactly the right length.* Within 24 seeds,
**77%** of items have a residue permutation rendering to exactly the natural token
count. :func:`shuffled_item_ids` therefore searches :data:`SHUFFLE_SEED_BUDGET`
seeds for an exact match and takes the first, which preserves composition exactly,
destroys order exactly and matches the token length exactly. Where no seed inside
that budget matches, the closest longer candidate is truncated to the required
token count -- a uniform random subsample of the item's residues, because a prefix
of a permutation is one -- and every such item is counted in the plan as
``shuffle_trimmed_items``. Conditioning on token count does mildly select
permutations whose local statistics are more BPE-compressible, which makes the
control look slightly *more* natural and the design correspondingly more
conservative; it is declared here rather than left implicit.

**The corpus draw seed.** The registration freezes ``20260826`` for this
campaign's own draws. The repository's cohort-draw contract requires every stage
that calls a corpus constructor to expose ``--cohort-draw-seed`` defaulting to the
one imported :data:`~src.transfer.arms.DEFAULT_CORPUS_DRAW_SEED`, and forbids a
stage from restating a seed as a literal. Both are honoured: the flag carries the
panel default and the campaign manifest pins it to :data:`DRAW_SEED`, which the
cohort artefact records and its digest covers.

The panel, and the three exclusions declared rather than dropped
================================================================
