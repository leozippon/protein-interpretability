"""MODEL - LOOKUP: what a protein decoder adds to a lookup of its own corpus.

**The subtraction this module supplies, and why the existing one is not enough.**
EXP-R2-134 measured MODEL - FREE over all 217 ProteinGym substitution assays:
ProGen3-112M's zero-shot fitness beats a BLOSUM62 substitution-matrix lookup by
+0.0647 Spearman [+0.0386, +0.0909]. That is the whole of this programme's
evidence that a protein decoder knows anything about function, and it cannot
separate the two accounts that matter. BLOSUM62 is free of the corpus, so a model
that had merely *stored* its pretraining data would beat it exactly as a model
that had *learned* anything would. The missing comparison is MODEL - LOOKUP,
where LOOKUP is a site-independent position-specific profile built by aligning
each assay's wild type against the arm's own pretraining corpus. Whatever a
column-frequency lookup of the corpus already knows is retrieved, not acquired;
what the model adds on top of it is the part that needs an explanation.

The estimand is measured against **wet-lab phenotype** -- ProteinGym's DMS scores
-- rather than against a predicted structure or a sequence-inferred label, which
is the property the audit's D1.c survey says the objective's second half lacks an
instrument for.

**Nothing here is fitted and no DMS label touches the channel.** The profile is a
weighted column frequency of DIAMOND hits; the pseudocount weight ``alpha`` is
declared in :data:`PSEUDOCOUNT_ALPHA` before any run and swept afterwards. In
particular the channel does not route through a trained probe: audit section 7
rejects probe-derived directions on arrival, and a probe fitted on DMS labels
would make the "lookup" arm a supervised predictor and the subtraction
meaningless.

**Three hazards this module is built around.**

*Repeat masking.* DIAMOND's default query masking truncated the alignments of
records that were byte-identical corpus members and pushed them out of the
near-duplicate stratum (audit 0.05, EXP-R2-061); every error ran in the direction
that defeated the hypothesis under test. :func:`~.homology.run_diamond_blastp`
now passes ``--masking 0`` and :func:`~.homology.assign_homology` refuses a
truncated alignment. This module adds the measured anchor those two lacked:
:func:`verbatim_anchor_check` reads the corpus directly for byte-identical wild
types and refuses the run unless every one of them lands in the top identity
stratum. On the 2026-08-07 corpus that anchor set is 73 of 187 wild types in
UniRef50 and 78 in Swiss-Prot union UniRef50, so it is a real constraint rather
than a formality.

*The unit of independence.* 217 assays carry 187 distinct wild types and many of
those are homologous; L1's cohort made the analogous error one level down, by
treating millions of mutant rows over one wild type as independent units. Wild
types are clustered at 50% identity (:func:`cluster_by_identity`), assay-level
differences are averaged within cluster, and every interval resamples clusters
under the floor in :data:`~.statistics.MINIMUM_BOOTSTRAP_UNITS`.

*A verbatim-presence split cannot be the axis.* 78 of 187 wild types are present
byte-identically, so "in the corpus" against "not in the corpus" is a 39/61 cut
that answers a different, cruder question. The stratifier is graded instead: max
identity to the corpus, and log10 Neff of homologues, both declared in residues,
both reported over a sweep of bin edges with the ordering required invariant
(Appendix B rule 17) and beside a threshold-free Kendall tau.

    Ordinary least squares with an intercept over a handful of declared

    coefficient of determination, which is the honest measure of how much
    difficulty there was to remove: a negative value means the difficulty model

    """The pre-registered reading of the interval, including what a null says.

    ``acquired``
        the MODEL - LOOKUP interval lies wholly above zero. The model carries
        fitness information a site-independent lookup of its own corpus does not.

    ``retrieval_bounded``
        the interval lies wholly inside plus or minus
        :data:`EQUIVALENCE_FRACTION` of the arm's own measured MODEL - BLOSUM62
        advantage. This is the null that establishes something: at least half of
        everything the model has over a free baseline is also available from the
        corpus lookup, so the acquired component is bounded and small.

    ``retrieval_dominated``
        the interval lies wholly below minus that bound. The lookup beats the
        model by more than the equivalence bound, so the question is resolved
        *against* the model.

        **Added after the fact, and that is recorded rather than hidden.** The
        first three outcomes were declared before any number existed and did not
        cover this case; ProGen3-112M produced it (-0.0808 [-0.1139, -0.0481]
        against a bound of 0.0340) and fell through to ``indeterminate``, whose
        stated reason -- "the interval spans zero" -- was false of that interval
        and whose documented meaning is that the cohort could not resolve the
        question, when it had resolved it decisively. A category that can only
        ever make an arm look worse cannot be a category chosen to favour a
        hypothesis, which is why adding it after seeing the data is admissible
        here; the three original readings are unchanged.

    ``indeterminate``
        the interval spans zero and leaves the equivalence bound, or the arm's
        own MODEL - BLOSUM62 advantage is not separable from zero so there is no
        advantage to partition. Not a null: a statement that this cohort cannot
        resolve the question, reported with the cluster count that could not
        resolve it.

    The bound is a fraction of the arm's *own* advantage rather than a fixed
    Spearman, because the arms differ in how much they beat a free baseline at
    all and an absolute bound would be a different question on each one. Where
    that advantage is not itself separable from zero there is nothing to
    partition, and the equivalence reading is withheld.
