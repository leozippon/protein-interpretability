"""External confirmation of the first-order likelihood finding on Domainome 1.0.

The capability map's last step confirms the strongest findings of the map on data
used in neither development panel. This module owns that step's endpoint, its
label-blind support rules, its declared controls and its nested held-group
comparison. It measures a **different measured quantity** from both development
sources and is not a replication of either estimand:

* the development mutation-ranking axis is ProteinGym's 217 heterogeneous deep
  mutational scans, 64 of whose readout anchor assays are Tsuboyama 2023;
* the development stability axis is cDNA-display proteolysis on the same
  Tsuboyama 2023 source;
* this endpoint is cellular abundance by protein-fragment complementation
  (aPCA) in *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*, from Beltran and Lehner's Domainome 1.0.

Agreement across two different measured quantities is stronger evidence than
agreement within one, and it is not a repeat measurement of either, so a
disagreement here is not by itself a failure to replicate.

The target is

    f = normalized_fitness of one single amino-acid substitution,

dimensionless, normalised by the source per domain so that the wild type reads
0 and the median nonsense variant reads about -1. Larger is greater abundance,
so a destabilising or abundance-lowering substitution gives a negative f. There
is no second measured state: the wild-type reference is identically zero by the
source's construction, which is what makes this endpoint a one-estimate level
rather than the two-estimate difference the stability gate targets.

Three support rules are declared here rather than discovered.

* **Development overlap is excluded by sequence, not by identifier.** No
  ProteinGym entry names Beltran or the domainome, yet 28 of the 522 domains
  match a development target exactly or by containment. Those 28 are excluded
  from the declared support by name, and every retained wild type is
  additionally screened by local alignment against all 217 ProteinGym targets
  and all 478 Tsuboyama backgrounds under a declared identity and coverage rule.
* **One accession, one Pfam family and one alignment component are one group.**
  Two domains cut from one protein are not independent units, so the family
  grouping unions shared UniProt accession, shared Pfam accession, exact
  sequence identity and the frozen grouping contract's own alignment edge rule.
* **At most a declared cap of variants per domain**, drawn by a stable hash of
  the draw seed, the domain identifier and the mutant sequence. The rule reads
  no measurement, no standard error and no model score.

Weighting, folds, the ridge recipe, the projection and the group bootstrap are
imported from the admitted Readout and pairwise recipes rather than restated,
and every feature block is imported from the stability gate rather than
reimplemented, so the control side of this confirmation is the same code the
development measurement fitted. The independent unit is the family group; inside
a group each domain carries equal weight, inside a domain each mutated site, and
inside a site each variant. That three-level nesting is the one the stability
gate's own endpoint qualification declares for a resampling unit holding several
backgrounds, and it is the one substitution this module makes to the
development fit's two-level weighting, which assumed one background per group.
