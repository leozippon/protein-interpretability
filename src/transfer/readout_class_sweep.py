"""Readout-class sweep over the frozen readout states of the admitted panel.

The representation is held fixed. What varies is the class of function fitted to
it: the penalty range, whether the four block summaries enter compressed or at
full width, whether the head is linear or a random-feature approximation of a
radial-basis kernel, and which depth and pooling block is supplied. Everything
else -- cohort, assay support, panel, split seeds, outer and inner fold maps,
equal cluster/assay/variant weights, within-assay standardized-rank targets,
training-only feature scaling, the ridge objective and tie rule, the 2,000-draw
paired cluster bootstrap at alpha 0.05 and its unit -- is imported unchanged from
:mod:`src.transfer.readout_analysis` and :mod:`src.transfer.profile_increment`,
so every estimate is directly comparable to its admitted baseline.

A resolved increment in a class states that a function of that class carries
mutation-effect information the matched supervised baseline does not; it does not
locate where that information came from. An unresolved or negative increment
states that no function this class reached carries such information, and is bound
by the classes actually fitted, the label budget and the two extraction depths the
retained artifacts hold.
