"""Long-range but additive sequence context: the gate's declared control block,
its bounded-receptive-field comparator and the nested held-group comparison that
re-estimates the model increments over them.

The gate this module implements asks one question about the flagship pairwise
result in ``docs/D1_PAIRWISE_EPISTASIS_RESULTS.md``: can the residual model-side
information on the wild-type-centred cycle be explained by longer-range but still
primarily additive sequence context, rather than by pairwise interaction? The
existing controls cannot answer it. The sequence/profile control C carries
mutation identities, positions, whole-sequence composition, a whole-sequence
dipeptide difference and mutation-local profile summaries; the nuisance control G
applies one global monotone response to an additive prediction. Neither
represents a per-position effect that depends on distant sequence content.

Two blocks are declared here, both built from per-site vectors summed over the
cycle's two mutated sites:

``W``  the bounded-receptive-field comparator. Every coordinate reads only
       residues within :data:`BOUNDED_RADIUS` of its own mutated site.
``X``  the global-context block. It carries ``W`` as its leading coordinates and
       adds the sequence content outside the mutation-local window at four
       declared ranges, the full-background rung of the window ladder, the
       distant composition, the size of each outside set and the distances to
       both termini.

Additive by construction, and this is the condition that makes the gate
meaningful. :func:`site_context_features` receives one site, that site's own
substituted residue and the **wild-type** background. It cannot read the other
mutated site's index or its substitution, so no coordinate of either block is a
function of both sites. :func:`cycle_context_features` is the plain sum of the
two per-site vectors, so a linear readout of either block equals a sum of two
per-site terms with no cross-site term, at any range. Computing the context on
the wild-type background rather than on the double mutant is what buys that: a
context read off the double mutant would carry the other site's substitution and
would be a cross-site term.

The comparison keeps every convention of the flagship fit rather than restating
it: the weights, folds, ridge recipe, penalty grid, tie rule, nonlinear-additive
nuisance, group-equal squared error and group bootstrap are all imported from
:mod:`~.pairwise_epistasis` and :mod:`~.readout_analysis`. The independent unit
is the site pair, never the cycle count.
