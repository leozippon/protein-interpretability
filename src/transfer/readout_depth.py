"""Depth-resolved frozen readout over every transformer block of an admitted arm.

The admitted readout panel hooked exactly two blocks per arm -- the block after
half the stack and the last block -- and retained the target-residue-token mean
and the last residue-token state at each. Its panel-wide near-null is therefore
bounded by two depths and two pooling rules. This module holds the
representation family fixed in every other respect and resolves depth: one
forward pass per sequence captures every block's output under the same two
pooling rules, and, where a rendering assigns exactly one token per residue so
that a wild type and a mutant occupy the same token grid, also two
position-resolved summaries localized on the substituted residues.

Everything the admitted study fixed is imported from its own modules rather
than restated: the cohort, the assay supports, the wild-type-family folds and
their seeds, the within-assay standardized-rank targets, the equal
cluster/assay/variant weights, the training-only weighted feature scaling, the
ridge objective, penalty grid and tie rule, and the 2,000-draw paired cluster
bootstrap at alpha 0.05 over the unit *wild-type family at 50% identity*.

A resolved positive increment at some depth states that a compressed linear
function of that depth's summaries carries mutation-effect information the
matched supervised baseline does not; it does not locate where that information
came from. An unresolved or negative increment states that no function this
class reached at that depth carries such information, and is bound by the
compression, the pooling and position rules, the label budget and the cohort.
