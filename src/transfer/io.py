"""The one way a transfer measurement reaches disk.

Every stage artefact this programme cites was written through :func:`write_json`,
and the two properties that matter are not stylistic:

**Atomic.** A campaign stage writes its report only after its whole per-arm loop
finishes. A partial file left by an interrupted write is indistinguishable from a
complete one to a reader that only checks the schema version, and this programme
has already lost a run to a stage that wrote and then raised.

**NaN-rejecting.** ``json.dump`` emits bare ``NaN`` and ``Infinity`` by default,
which are not JSON, and a downstream reader that accepts them turns a
non-finite intermediate into a plotted point. Every numeric guard in
``src/transfer`` exists to make a non-finite value raise where it is produced;
serialising one silently would undo all of them at the last step.

Before EXP-R2-066 this module was ``src/revision/io.py``, shared with the
retired CLT/dictionary-qualification scope, and ``scripts/transfer_gap/tg_common.py``
carried a *third*, non-atomic ``write_json`` of its own. Appendix B rule 12 --
a single declaration, imported, never reimplemented -- applies to serialisation
as much as to rendering.
