"""The pattern every gate already follows, written down once.

Each gate of the capability map runs the same six steps in order and reports at
whatever step it has reached: endpoint qualification, baseline and control
qualification, native model behaviour, representation readout, held-family and
remote-family generalization, and causal validation where justified. That
sequence is declared in :doc:`docs/D1_CAPABILITY_MAP_PLAN.md`; what it does not
have is a form a reader or a test can check a gate against, so a gate that
reported a representation verdict as final, or a control whose own contribution
carries no interval, would read as complete.

This module is that form and nothing more. It is the smallest abstraction the
existing gates can be expressed in, and it deliberately does **not** refactor
them: each gate keeps its own modules, scripts and record, and what is declared
here is a read-only transcription of the elements its record already carries,
checked against the contract's rules and, where a record is supplied, against
that record's own bytes.

Four rules carry the substance, and each exists because a gate record already
shows why:

**A control must carry its own contribution with an interval.** The stability
gate keeps a control block whose own contribution is +0.00390 [-0.00068,
+0.00864], an interval containing zero, and records that this makes *beyond
controls* weaker than the phrase suggests. A contract that accepted a control
without an interval would hide exactly that.

**A representation verdict is not available while the readout reassessment is
open.** Every representation-level verdict is provisional until the reassessment
completes, so an element at that step may be provisional, not applicable or
absent, and a gate declaring it reported diverges from the contract.

**A likelihood element is not deferred.** A native likelihood enters as one
scalar column, so a linear readout of it is close to the full function space over
that feature; the asymmetry is what makes the sequencing rule tractable and is
expressed here rather than left to each gate.

**A step not reached is named, not omitted.** *Unresolved*, *not detected*, *not
applicable* and *absent* are four different states, and a gate that stopped at
step 1 records the later steps as absent with the reason.
