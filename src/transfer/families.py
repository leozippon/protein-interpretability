"""Family-disjoint splits over externally curated protein families.

Why this is one component and not a line in each stage
=====================================================

Every pending part-3 item ends in the same sentence: *and it reproduces on an
unseen protein family*. This programme has already recorded what happens when
that sentence is asserted rather than built. ``ConceptSpec.family_disjoint`` was
declared ``True`` for the fitness concept while ProteinGym ships four
``BLAT_ECOLX`` assays of one 286-residue protein, so the field said
"family-disjoint" and the data said "forty mutants of one protein" (§0.05 of the
audit). The defect was not the value of a flag; it was that no code computed the
property the flag claimed. Here the property is computed, is refused when it
does not hold, and is *measured* rather than asserted.

What a split from this module does and does not control
=======================================================

It controls leakage **between our own fitting side and our own evaluation
side**: no curated family is represented on both. That is the split under which
"the method generalises beyond the families it was tuned on" is a statement
about the method.

It does **not** control leakage into the *model's* pretraining corpus, and
nothing that can be built from public protein data would. ProtGPT2 was trained
on UniRef50 and Swiss-Prot lies inside it by construction, so every evaluation
protein this repository can reach is a candidate training member whatever family
it belongs to. That question has its own instruments -- :mod:`.homology` for the
identity stratification and :mod:`.profiles` for the retrieval bound -- and a
family-disjoint split neither replaces nor weakens them. A result quoted from
this module's split must say which of the two leaks it has closed.

The two label sources, and why neither is the other
===================================================

*Pfam family* (``pfam``), from the residue-span table :mod:`.channels` already
reads. Cheap, keyed on UniProt accession, and covers 523,433 Swiss-Prot entries.
Two proteins are in one group when they share a Pfam domain family, so the unit
is *domain-family* membership.

*CATH superfamily* (``cath_superfamily``), from the ``G3DSA:`` Gene3D signatures
in InterPro's ``protein2ipr`` dump. Gene3D assigns CATH superfamilies, so the
unit is *structural* superfamily membership, which groups remote homologues that
Pfam separates and is therefore the stricter of the two. It has to be extracted
once; see :func:`extract_cath_superfamilies`.

Running a result under both is the split-definition analogue of Appendix B rule
17: the grouping unit is a free choice, so the ordering has to survive changing
it.

``/Data/public/datasets/cath-s40`` cannot supply the second source
==================================================================

Recorded here because the resource inventory that motivated this module said it
could. The staged dump holds three files -- a 34,653-line list of CATH **domain
identifiers**, the matching ATOM-record FASTA, and the domain coordinate
tarball. A CATH domain identifier (``12asA00``) is a PDB code, a chain and a
domain index; **it does not encode the C.A.T.H superfamily**, and no
``CathDomainList`` is staged beside it. The dump also carries no UniProt
accession, so it does not join to Swiss-Prot, AlphaFold, Pfam, PhosphoSite or
ProteinGym, all of which this programme keys on accession.

What it *is* good for is a guarantee this module cannot provide: its records are
pairwise below 40% sequence identity, so any split of it is identity-disjoint at
40% without a grouping at all. Making it superfamily-disjoint needs a ~4 MB
``CathDomainList`` fetch that has not been made; until then ``cath_superfamily``
here comes from InterPro and is keyed on accession.

Composition, for a three-way split
==================================

The role a lens needs is usually three-way -- fit the translator, choose the
layer, report -- and this module deliberately exposes only a two-way split.
Split once, then call :meth:`FamilyAssignment.select` on the training side and
split that. Because no group is ever divided, all three sides are pairwise
family-disjoint; ``tests/test_family_splits.py`` holds that as an executable
property rather than as this paragraph.

Not to be confused with :func:`statistics.make_group_splits`, which builds
grouped *cross-validation folds* for a supervised probe and needs labels. This
module builds one unlabelled fit/held-out partition for a method that is fitted
on one population and reported on another.

    """Measure, rather than assert, that the two sides are unrelated.

    A curated family label is incomplete. Two proteins can be close homologues
    and carry no family in common -- an unannotated region, a family split
    between releases, a domain the signature missed -- and then the split is
    family-disjoint and not homology-disjoint, which is the failure the audit
    already records once.

    The measurement is k-mer Jaccard, the same similarity
    ``relational.homology_clusters`` groups on. Cross-boundary pairs are compared
    against **same-group** pairs, because the scale that matters is "as similar
    as two proteins we have already agreed are relatives".

    **``cross_max`` is the alarm; ``n_cross_above_same_group_median`` is only
    interpretable when the grouping is a sequence family, and this was measured
    rather than assumed.** On 400 Swiss-Prot proteins in the 64-246 band, the
    same-group median is 0.061-0.073 under Pfam grouping and 0.026-0.034 under
    CATH superfamily grouping, because superfamily members are remote homologues
    with little sequence similarity left -- which is the property that makes CATH
    the stricter split in the first place. The count above that median therefore
    reads 0-31 of ~35,000 pairs under Pfam and 917-3,335 of ~15,000 under CATH on
    the *same* cohort, and the second number is measuring how low the reference
    is, not how leaky the split is. ``cross_max`` moved over the identical range
    (0.072-0.218) under both. Read the maximum; read the count only against a
    sequence-family grouping.

    On a cohort whose every group is a singleton the reference does not exist and
    is reported as ``None``, not as a number. Above ``sample_pairs`` both
    populations are subsampled -- cross-boundary pairs with replacement, same-group
    pairs by walking a seeded permutation of the groups rather than the first few,
    which is Appendix B rule 1 applied to a control instead of to a cohort.
