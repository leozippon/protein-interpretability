"""Intervals for the cohort information estimand, resampled at the unit of dependence.

The estimand is one number per scored cohort and arm,

    I = H_baseline - H_model      (nats per scored token)

with the two terms estimated on **exactly the same token multiset**:

    H_model    = (sum_r clean_nll_sum_r) / (sum_r token_count_r)
    H_baseline = -(1/N) sum_v c(v) log q(v),
                 q(v) = (r(v) + a) / (R + a*V)

where ``c(v)`` counts the cohort's scored target tokens, ``r(v)`` counts the
disjoint reference set's, ``R = sum_v r(v)``, ``V`` is the declared vocabulary
and ``a`` is the additive smoothing constant. Both terms are therefore
token-weighted averages over the *same* ``N`` tokens, and

    I = (1/N) sum_i log[ p_model(t_i) / q(t_i) ]

is a mean of per-token contrasts. Three facts follow, and each of them is a
property this module exists to preserve.

**The two terms are paired.** They are averages over one token multiset, so a
resampling scheme that draws the cohort twice -- once for the model term and once
for the baseline term -- estimates the variance of a difference of two
*independent* cohorts, which is far larger than the variance of the paired
difference the estimand actually is. One cohort draw feeds both terms, always.
``tests/test_information_bootstrap.py::test_sharing_the_cohort_draw_narrows_the_interval``
drives :func:`_statistics_from_weights` with the pairing deliberately broken and
asserts the width ordering, because this is the one property whose violation
still produces a plausible-looking interval.

**The baseline is a random quantity too.** ``q`` is fitted on a finite reference
set, so the reference is resampled -- independently of the cohort, since the two
corpora are disjoint by construction -- and ``q`` is refitted inside every draw
with the same smoothing constant. Holding it fixed understates the interval;
the same test file asserts that inequality rather than assuming it.

**Sequences are not the unit of independence, and neither are tokens.** Groups
are, so groups are what is resampled, and the floor that governs every other
percentile interval in this package (:data:`~src.transfer.statistics.MINIMUM_BOOTSTRAP_UNITS`)
is applied to the **token-weighted Kish effective group count**

    n_eff = (sum_g w_g)^2 / sum_g w_g^2,   w_g = scored tokens in group g

rather than to the raw group count. A cohort of forty groups one of which
carries 95% of the tokens has an effective count near one; its raw count clears
the floor and its interval does not mean what it says. Below the floor the
interval is **refused**. There is no record-level fallback: when dependence
inside groups is maximal, record-level resampling returns a *narrower* interval,
so the fallback would answer a request for an honest bound with a
confidently wrong one.

The floor binds on the **cohort** only, because the cohort is what defines the
estimand. A reference set with few effective groups contributes a variance
component that is itself estimated from few atoms, and that gap is not closed
here: ``reference_n_effective_groups`` is published beside every interval so it
can be read, and a thin reference also announces itself through the bias
described at the end of this docstring.

Everything is computed from per-record sufficient statistics -- a scalar NLL sum,
a token count, a symbol count and a sparse target-token count vector -- through
weighted sums over per-group aggregates, so a draw costs one sparse
matrix-multivector product and no token sequence is ever materialised. Only the
cohort's own token support is carried, because the baseline enters the
arithmetic as

    sum_v c(v) log q(v) = sum_{v in support} c(v) log(r(v) + a) - N log(R + a*V)

and the reference mass outside that support reaches the estimate only through
the scalar ``R``.

**The blind spot this scheme cannot resample away.** A cohort token the
reference never saw has ``r(v) = 0`` in the full reference and in every
resample of it -- resampling removes mass, it cannot create it -- so its
contribution to the baseline is the smoothing constant alone and varies across
draws only through the normaliser. The share of cohort tokens in that position,
and the share whose reference count is five or fewer, are reported on every
result: they measure how much of the baseline is pseudo-count rather than
corpus, and that part carries no sampling uncertainty here even though it
carries plenty of estimation error.

**A point where the estimand is known to be zero.** Every criterion applied to
``I`` -- a floor on it, a sign test on its interval -- is a claim about the
estimator's behaviour near zero, and the panel supplies no arm that sits there.
:func:`unigram_null_control` builds one: an arm whose predictive distribution
*is* a smoothed unigram fitted on a reference from a disjoint corpus block, so
both terms of ``I`` estimate the same population from independent samples and
the true value is zero by construction. It is an ordinary ``ArmStatistics`` and
goes through the same :func:`bootstrap_arms` call as the arms beside it.

**The percentile interval can sit above the point estimate, and that is not a
bug.** ``H_baseline`` is ``-sum c(v) log q_b(v)`` and ``-log`` is convex, so a
resampled reference gives ``E[H_baseline_b] > H_baseline`` by Jensen. The gap
grows as the reference shrinks against its vocabulary -- the same axis the
smoothing bias lives on. Measured here on a deliberately small reference (2000
tokens over a 256-symbol vocabulary) it reaches +0.047 nats, enough to put the
whole 95% percentile interval for ``I`` above the point estimate at
``z0 = -2.0``. Nothing is corrected for it: this package has no BCa
implementation, a bias estimate at these draw counts is itself noisy, and a
silently shifted interval is indistinguishable from a measurement. What the
result carries instead is ``bootstrap_bias`` and ``median_bias_z0`` on every
statistic, so the condition is visible rather than inferable, and the remedy is
a larger reference corpus rather than a different interval.

    :class:`ArmStatistics` and goes through :func:`bootstrap_arms` beside the
    real arms of its block, under the same resample indices, so it is measured
    by the same estimator rather than by a parallel one.

    **Why the true ``I`` is zero.** Both terms of ``I = H_baseline - H_model``
    are then the cross-entropy of one token multiset under a smoothed unigram of
    the same population: the baseline's is fitted on this block's held-out
    reference, the model's on the caller's. Two estimators of the same
    distribution, fitted on independent samples of comparable size, differ only
    by their estimation error, so ``E[I] = 0`` under exchangeability of the two
    samples -- while the *measured* ``I`` fluctuates with realistic noise and
    carries the same vocabulary-dependent smoothing constant every real arm
    carries. That is a point at which an eligibility criterion can be watched
    behaving, or misbehaving, at a known zero. An untrained model is not such a
    point: near-uniform logits cost about ``log V`` nats and land the arm far
    below any floor, several nats from the boundary the criteria live at.

    **The control's reference must not be the baseline's.** Fitted on the same
    counts, ``q_control`` *is* ``q_baseline``, the point estimate of ``I`` is
    zero identically rather than by measurement, and what the interval then
    describes is the noise of refitting the baseline against a model held fixed
    at its full-sample value -- a quantity with no bearing on any criterion.
    That case is refused here rather than reported, because a tautological zero
    and a measured one are indistinguishable once written to an artefact.
    Equality of the two count vectors is the exact condition, so it is what is
    checked; a caller that also knows the two samples' provenance should say so
    in its own record, since equal counts are the symptom and shared provenance
    is the cause.

    The exchangeability the zero rests on is the caller's to justify. Two
    reference sets drawn from different regions of one corpus are independent
    but not necessarily identically distributed, and under such a shift a
    mismatched unigram costs more than the matched one, which biases the
    measured ``I`` *downwards*. The direction is known and the size is not, so a
    control reading below zero bounds the criteria conservatively and a control
    reading above zero cannot be explained away by it.
