"""Mutation-centred local-context controls, and the gate that admits one.

Why this module exists
======================

The crossed-controls study declared a local-pattern block ``L`` -- 400 exact
dipeptide count differences plus a 256-coordinate fixed Gaussian projection of
the 8,000 tripeptide count differences over the complete sequence -- and that
block failed as a control. It lowered the held-cluster Spearman of the control it
augmented by 0.04747 from C and by 0.01684 from C+P. A control that lowers its
own baseline licenses no conclusion, so the local-motif rung carries no verdict:
that is different from a representation having exceeded it.

The blocks here are built on the opposite design choice. ``L`` counted specific
k-mer identities over the whole sequence, which is high-dimensional, sparse and
family-specific: which particular dipeptide a substitution destroys is close to
unique to one wild type, so a coefficient fitted on training clusters has almost
nothing to transfer to a held-out cluster. These blocks instead describe the
*neighbourhood* of the mutated position in a coarsened, dense encoding at
declared radii: chemical-class composition, physicochemical window means, and
substitution-matrix compatibility between the substituted residue and its
neighbours. Every coordinate is an average over residues, so a coefficient
fitted on one family is a statement about local chemistry rather than about one
family's k-mer inventory.

The limited-receptive-field comparator
======================================

:func:`receptive_field_features` is the cleanest operationalisation of "local
information": a predictor that sees the bounded window around each mutated
position and nothing else. It receives no absolute position, no sequence length,
no global composition and no alignment quantity, and the test suite enforces
that by construction -- changing a residue outside every window, or moving the
same window content to a different position in a longer sequence, must leave its
rows unchanged.

Its pooling over a variant's substitutions is a sum rather than a mean, because
sum pooling is what a bounded-receptive-field encoder does and because the
substitution count is then recoverable inside the block (the wild-type half's
total mass is the number of in-sequence window positions) rather than having to
be supplied from outside the window.

The qualification gate
======================

No candidate may be used to measure anything before it has been shown to
generalise across held-out wild-type clusters itself. :func:`qualification_gate`
is that rule, applied to control-versus-control correlations only: a candidate
qualifies when adding it does not lower the held-cluster correlation of either
baseline it augments, at every declared split seed. Nothing in the gate reads a
model quantity, so a candidate cannot be tuned against the increment it is later
meant to absorb, which would invert the logic of a control.

Estimation discipline
=====================

Every estimation decision is imported unchanged from the admitted Readout
recipe, through the same call sites the crossed-controls study uses:
:func:`~.readout_analysis.sequence_features` supplies the composition control,
:func:`~.crossed_controls.profile_features` the mutation-local profile block,
:func:`~.readout_analysis.nested_predict` the nested held-cluster folds, equal
cluster and within-cluster assay weights, training-only weighted feature scaling
and the inner rank-mean-squared-error ridge selection, and
:func:`~.profile_increment.summarize` the cluster-bootstrap intervals. Nothing
here refits, reorders or reweights those choices, which is what makes these
numbers compose with the crossed-controls tables directly.
