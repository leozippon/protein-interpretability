"""ProGen3, loaded so that it cannot come back silently random.

**Why this module exists.** The entry point everyone calls,
``ProGen3ForCausalLM.from_pretrained(path, moe_implementation="eager")``,
*succeeds* on the released checkpoints. It emits a "newly initialized" warning,
returns a model whose embeddings, attention and norms are loaded correctly, and
whose every expert and every router is freshly random -- because the released
weights are in **megablocks packing** and carry no key the eager
``SparseMoeBlock`` recognises. Nothing raises. The model generates. It scores
Swiss-Prot at **17.15 nats/token** against the **1.983** the same checkpoint
reaches once the experts are actually loaded (EXP: ``progen3_eager_probe``,
steps 08-09, one L20). A measurement taken on that object is a measurement of
noise wearing a checkpoint's name, and no exception separates the two.

:func:`load_progen3` is therefore the only supported way into these checkpoints
in this repository. It converts the packed tensors, loads them with
``strict=True``, and refuses on any missing or unexpected key.

**The conversion**, verified against megablocks 0.7.0's ``LearnedRouter`` and
``MemoryOptimizedGroupedGLU`` and against the eager block's own forward, with
``9216 = 8 experts x 1152`` on the 112M and ``30720 = 8 x 3840`` on the 3B:

===========================================  ===========================================
released (megablocks packing)                eager ``SparseMoeBlock``
===========================================  ===========================================
``...block_sparse_moe.experts.mlp.w1``       ``...experts.{e}.w1.weight``  split
``...block_sparse_moe.experts.mlp.v1``       ``...experts.{e}.w3.weight``  split
``...block_sparse_moe.experts.mlp.w2``       ``...experts.{e}.w2.weight``  split + transpose
``...block_sparse_moe.router.layer.weight``  ``...block_sparse_moe.gate.weight``  rename
``mlm_head.weight``                          dropped: ``ProGen3ForCausalLM`` has no MLM head
===========================================  ===========================================

**The mapping is load-bearing and the evidence says a wrong one is unmissable.**
Under the mapping above, on the 112M: UniRef50 2.588 (the paper reports ~2.50),
Swiss-Prot 1.983, residue-shuffled Swiss-Prot 2.940, uniform over 20 residues
2.996. Corrupting the mapping while keeping ``strict=True`` clean: ``w1``/``v1``
swapped 3.201, gate rows rolled by one expert 3.173. Both are *worse than
shuffled protein*, so a mapping error cannot hide inside a plausible number --
provided something looks. :func:`self_check` is the thing that looks.

**Two checkpoints, one packing, two bands.** 112M and 3B ship the same
megablocks packing under the same tensor names, so
:func:`convert_megablocks_state_dict` serves both unchanged. What differs is the
file layout -- the 3B arrives in two safetensors shards named by a
``model.safetensors.index.json`` -- the placement of the attention, which the
3B's ``fused_attention_norm`` moves under ``norm_attn_norm``, and above all the
*number*. A correctly loaded 3B scores far below a correctly loaded 112M, so a
single shared band would either reject the larger checkpoint or stop
discriminating on the smaller one. :data:`SELF_CHECK_REFERENCES` therefore
declares each checkpoint's own measured value and its own corruption controls,
and a config matching no declared entry is refused rather than gated against
somebody else's number.

**What this module deliberately does not do.** It imports the patched
third-party ``progen3`` package by path and nothing else from that tree; the
tree is CC BY-NC-ND, git-ignored, and must not be vendored. It needs neither
megablocks (the eager block replaces it) nor flash-attn (a pure-PyTorch fp32
RMSNorm replaces the fused kernel); both substitutions are local patches to the
ignored copy, not to this repository.
