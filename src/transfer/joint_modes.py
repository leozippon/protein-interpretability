"""How one joint language-protein checkpoint is rendered in each of its modes.

A joint decoder has two input formats and one set of weights, so Appendix B rule
4 -- feed every arm the format it was trained on, and verify the rendering
against the model's own likelihood -- applies twice to the same checkpoint. This
module is the single place either format is decided (Appendix B rule 12);
``scripts/transfer/21_joint_mode_qualification.py`` names a family on the command
line and reads everything else from here.

**Why the per-residue escape is load-bearing rather than cosmetic.** Galactica's
protein format is ``[START_AMINO]...[END_AMINO]``, and its released
``tokenizer.json`` carries a ``Split`` pretokenizer on the literal
``SPL1T-TH1S-Pl3A5E`` with ``behavior: "Removed"`` -- so the marker is consumed by
the tokenizer itself, and inserting it before every residue is the *supported*
way to reach the model's own one-token-per-residue protein alphabet rather than a
workaround. Without it ``AutoTokenizer`` silently merges residues into
multi-residue BPE pieces at about 1.79 residues per token, and the measured cost
of that merge is 2.886 nats/token on ``galactica-1.3b`` (EXP-R2-151). Nothing
about a merged rendering looks wrong in an artefact -- the run completes, the
numbers are finite, and they are a measurement of a different object. That is why
:meth:`JointTokenisation.render` **raises** on a rendering that declared the
per-residue alphabet and did not reach it, instead of recording a warning field
nobody reads.

**The symbol unit is declared, because not every family has one.** Galactica and
InstructProtein both reach a per-residue alphabet, so a scored position *is* a
residue and the estimand is in nats per residue. ProLLaMA does not: its trained
protein format is ``Seq=<...>`` over the unmodified 32000-piece LLaMA-2
SentencePiece vocabulary, which merges ``TA``, ``IA``, ``IS``, ``SH``, ``FS`` and
several hundred other residue runs into single pieces at about 1.54 residues per
token on a Swiss-Prot draw. That is not a rendering defect that an escape could
repair -- there is no escape, and the merged rendering *is* what the checkpoint
was trained on. The difference between the two cases cannot live at a call site,
because a caller cannot tell them apart; it lives in
:attr:`JointRendering.symbol_unit`, and it decides three things at once: which
verification a declared rendering must pass, what one scored symbol is, and
therefore what the estimand's unit is.

The guard is unchanged for the families that declare the residue as their unit.
:meth:`JointTokenisation.verify_one_token_per_residue` still raises, still takes
no flag, and is still what a residue-unit rendering is checked against.
:meth:`JointTokenisation.verify_symbol_unit` is the dispatcher that chooses it;
a token-unit family is checked against the property that holds for *it* -- every
scored target inside the enumerated residue-spelling support -- rather than
against a property it was never going to have.

**One derivation, three rules.** The families locate their scored positions
differently, and the difference follows from the format rather than from taste.
Galactica's residues are ordinary single-letter pieces of a text vocabulary and
are identified by *position* (strictly between the delimiter ids); InstructProtein
declares twenty dedicated ``ƤA``..``ƤY`` tokens and its residues are identified by
*identity*; ProLLaMA's delimiters ``Seq=<`` and ``>`` are not tokens of the
vocabulary at all -- ``Seq=<`` is three pieces -- so neither positional rule can
run, and its scored span is the one contiguous token run whose *spellings*
concatenate to exactly the sequence. That third rule fails loudly when a residue
merges into a delimiter or into the document context, which is the failure a
delimiter-id rule would have caught by construction.

All three rules are read off the same declaration, and the residue token ids the
identity rule needs are derived by rendering a one-residue sequence through the
very same declaration and the very same span locator -- so a family cannot end up
with one alphabet for selection and another for verification.

    ``symbol_unit`` is what one scored symbol of this family's protein mode is,

    from a measurement: a residue-unit family whose tokenizer merged residues and
    a token-unit family reading its own trained format produce the same shape of
    record, and only the first is a defect.

    ``residue_escape`` is the string inserted into the *rendered text* before
    every residue. It is not necessarily part of the resulting token's spelling:
    Galactica's marker is removed by the pretokenizer, so the token is the bare

    added token. Nothing here needs to know which, because the residue token ids
    are derived from the tokenizer rather than spelled a second time. It is
    ``None`` exactly for a token-unit family: an escape that reached the model's
    per-residue alphabet would make the family a residue-unit one, and one that
