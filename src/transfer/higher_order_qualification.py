"""Qualifying a candidate dataset for an order-k interaction endpoint, before any model runs.

Why this exists. The higher-order gate has closed twice as *unresolved rather
than not-detected*, and both closures came from qualifying the endpoint rather
than from measuring a model. MegaScale ``dataset2`` carries zero substitution
variants of order three or above, every apparent one being an indel construct
whose ``aa_seq`` is truncated to wild-type length. ProteinGym carries 206,390
complete cubes, and its best-qualified support reaches a shared-to-discordance
ratio of 0.276 [0.000, 0.496] at 119.6 Kish effective site triples on 598 site
triples, against the admitted pairwise endpoint's 2.78 [2.34, 3.26] at a
comparable 121.6 -- while on that same assay the order-2 shared component *is*
resolved above zero at 0.0596 [0.0232, 0.0800] scaled-fitness units. The
third-order failure there is an order property of a well-powered assay's labels,
not an assay property.

Both closures asked the same five questions in the same order, and answered them
with code written twice. This module asks them once, of any candidate:

1. does the candidate carry **complete lower-order support**, and how much;
2. how many **independent site tuples across how many positions** -- never cube
   counts, because 25,035 complete triples once rested on the C(4, 3) = 4 site
   triples a four-position library has;
3. does it carry a **genuine replicate channel** or only counts, with the
   distinction stated, because a count-derived floor bounds sequencing and
   library sampling only and is therefore a *lower bound* on total noise;
4. what is the **order-k noise floor**, measured and propagated; and
5. does the **endpoint clear that floor**.

Stop is the default. :func:`candidate_verdict` schedules model scoring only when
every condition holds, and :func:`assert_scheduling_admitted` raises otherwise,
so a caller cannot read a permissive default off a record that did not qualify.

No model score, likelihood or representation enters anything here. The cube
contrast and its sign convention come from
:mod:`src.transfer.higher_order_cycle`; the completeness rule, the cube
addressing and the two-channel decomposition from
:mod:`src.transfer.proteingym_higher_order`. Neither is reimplemented.

#: The ratio a candidate's endpoint has to resolve above before any model
