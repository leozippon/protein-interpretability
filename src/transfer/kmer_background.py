"""The corpus fragment statistics a homologue-free referent is still exposed to.

Why this module exists
======================

Objective 3 needs a referent where retrieval is excluded *by construction*, and
EXP-R2-189 established that no natural protein supplies one: over 187 ProteinGym
wild types the least homologous is still 55.5% identical to a UniRef50 cluster.
The only class disjoint by construction is non-natural sequence, and the
certificate that decides disjointness is a DIAMOND search that returns no
alignment.

**A homologue-free referent is not an information-free one.** DIAMOND finding no
alignment says nothing about whether the referent's *fragments* are common in the
corpus. A decoder does not need to have seen a sequence to score it above chance;
it needs only to have seen its 3-mers and 4-mers, and every protein is built from
the same small alphabet. So the moment a design is certified zero-hit, the first
objection to any positive likelihood result is that the model is reproducing
corpus fragment statistics -- exactly the alternative Objective 3 exists to
exclude -- and the baseline that answers it has to be fragment-level, because the
homology-based LOOKUP baseline is empty by construction on a disjoint referent.

This module is that baseline's *input*: the background frequency of every 3-mer
and 4-mer in the staged corpus. It is deliberately a **count and not a model**.
Turning counts into a baseline needs a declared scoring rule -- what to do with
unseen contexts, how to combine positions, whether to condition -- and that is a
design decision that belongs to the stage that makes it, not to the counter.

What the count has to get right
===============================

One thing, and it is the reason the number is trustworthy at all: **a k-mer must
never span two records**. Concatenating a 24 GB FASTA and sliding a window over
it produces, at every one of 60 million record boundaries, a fragment that exists
in no protein. Those fragments are not rare noise -- they are systematically
*unusual*, because they join a C-terminus to an N-terminus, and a background that
contains them understates exactly the fragments a real sequence is made of.

The second thing is narrower and cost the previous artefact 3-4.5% of its
windows. FASTA wraps sequence lines, and the staged corpus wraps at 60 columns.
An implementation that treats the newline as an invalid symbol -- which is the
natural way to get the record-boundary property for free -- also drops every
window that spans a *line* break, which is one window in twenty for k = 3 and
one in fifteen for k = 4. The first pass over this corpus did exactly that: it
counted 16,640,807,917 3-mers against a record-local total of 17,156,475,069, a
3.01% shortfall, and 16,324,342,706 4-mers against 17,096,160,025, 4.51%. Line
wrapping is a property of the file format and not of the protein, so those
windows are real k-mers of real proteins and belong in the background.

The distinction matters less for the *distribution* than for the *count* -- line
breaks fall at fixed residue offsets and are uncorrelated with sequence content,
so dropping them is close to missing-at-random -- but a background whose stated
guarantee is "no k-mer crosses a record boundary" while it silently also drops
one window in twenty is a artefact whose documentation does not describe it.
This implementation joins a record's sequence lines and emits one invalid symbol
per header, so a window spans line breaks freely and can never span a record.

Chunking is the third thing, and it is tested rather than reasoned about. The
corpus does not fit in memory, so the pass is chunked; a chunk boundary is not a
record boundary and a window that straddles one must be counted exactly once.
:func:`count_kmers` therefore carries the trailing ``max(ks) - 1`` symbols across
chunks and counts, in each chunk, only the windows that reach new material. The
test suite runs the same file at several chunk sizes and requires identical
counts, because that is the only failure here that produces a plausible number.

Verification against an independent pass
=======================================

The residue total is checkable without trusting this module at all: DIAMOND's
``makedb`` reports the letters it indexed for the same FASTA. On the staged
UniRef50 that is 17,282,055,793 against this pass's 17,277,105,157, and the
0.03% difference is exactly the non-canonical residues (``X``, ``B``, ``Z``,
``U``, ``O``) that this module excludes and DIAMOND does not. Two independent
readers agreeing to 3 parts in 10,000 is what makes the count a measurement
rather than an assertion.
