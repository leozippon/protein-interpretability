"""Anchor-panel gate adapters: refit one published cell at a selected readout class.

The crossed-controls and local-context gates are fitted by stage *scripts*, not by
library modules. Their panel loader, profile-store binding, anchor-support
refusal, packed-token budget and control-block builders live in
``scripts/transfer/analyse_crossed_controls.py`` and
``scripts/transfer/analyse_local_context_gate.py``. This module loads those
scripts by file location and calls them unchanged, so a recomputation reads the
same arrays, builds the same control blocks and fits the same designs as the
published cell did. What it contributes is the representation block at the
selected class, the identity refusals, and the comparison.

It sits beside :mod:`src.transfer.recomputation` rather than inside it because
loading a production *script* by file location is a different dependency class
from anything the driver itself needs, and the driver should not acquire a
dependency on the scripts directory to plan a cell it is not running.

Both gates fit the same anchor panel -- 201 assays, 163 wild-type families at 50%
identity, 25,728 variants -- through the same loader, so one preparation serves
both and the two entry points differ only in the block builder and the evaluator
they call.
