"""The arithmetic a descriptive scale ladder is read with, declared once.

Two campaigns now compare checkpoints rung by rung on the same frozen queues:
EXP-R2-224's ProGen2 medium -> large -> xlarge first round, and EXP-R2-225's
independent second stage over larger public checkpoints. They ask the same
question of different rungs, so the *arithmetic* -- how a paired difference is
resampled over its original units, how a cohort is aligned across rungs, how a
stage-41 identification record is qualified -- must be one implementation, while
each campaign's **freeze** stays where it was written.

That split is deliberate and is what this module exists for. A freeze is a
promise about particular rungs, particular censuses and particular seeds; it
belongs in the stage that made it, next to the refusals that enforce it. The
arithmetic underneath is the same operation whatever it is pointed at, and a
second copy of it would be free to drift from the first exactly where the two
campaigns are supposed to be commensurable. Nothing here declares a rung, a
census, a seed or a resample count: every one of those arrives as an argument.

Two consequences follow, and both are load-bearing.

Rung order is checked here but never *chosen* here. :func:`require_rungs` takes
the tuple a caller froze and refuses anything else, so a stage that hands over
its own frozen order gets the same refusal it had when the check was local.

A census is optional and, when absent, is not checked rather than defaulted.
:class:`DmsCensus` and :class:`MegascaleCensus` are the fixed counts a campaign
declared; passing ``None`` means a caller is aligning payloads whose census is
not the frozen one -- a test fixture, a shape check -- and the structural
refusals (a rung-specific skip, a skip that is not a shared-context overflow, a
disagreeing digest) still all apply. There is no default census, because a
default would be a fourth place a frozen number could live.

The one class of *name* declared here is the scoring-strata vocabulary, and it
is not a campaign freeze. A rule that N-to-C, bidirectional and masked /
pseudo-likelihood scores are never pooled is only enforceable if the three have
spellings a scoring stage writes and a comparison stage reads; three string
literals in three files would be the drift this module exists to prevent, on the
quantity that decides whether a paired difference is a difference of
checkpoints or of estimands.

    each other by accident. Everything after the selection is the same
