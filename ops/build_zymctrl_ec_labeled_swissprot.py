"""Build a reviewed-enzyme EC-labeled FASTA for ZymCTRL-style CLT training.

This is a fallback replacement for the missing original `ec_labeled.fasta`.
It parses Swiss-Prot XML, extracts full EC numbers, and writes records in
the sequence format ZymCTRL was trained on:

    <EC><sep><start><AA_SEQUENCE><end>

If a protein entry has multiple complete EC numbers, one FASTA record is
emitted per EC label.

**The XML reader is no longer this script's.** It moved to
`src.transfer.sequence_description.iter_swissprot_entries`, which is now this
repository's one Swiss-Prot parser, and this script consumes it. Appendix B rule
12 -- a single declaration, imported, never reimplemented -- reaches *which
records exist* as much as it reaches what a model is fed, and a second parser is
a second answer to that question. What this script keeps is what is its own: the
EC-per-record fan-out, the length cut, and ZymCTRL's rendering.

Everything the old reader had earned is preserved in the shared one and is worth
naming, because both defences were paid for: the namespace is read from the
document's own root rather than hard-coded (UniProt has shipped both the `http`
and the `https` spelling, and against the wrong literal every entry is skipped
and an empty FASTA is written with exit 0), and the entry element is cleared
after each record so a 933 MB stream does not become a resident tree.

The refactor was checked rather than argued: run over an 8,000-entry prefix of
the release, the reader change reproduces this script's output byte for byte --
3,957 records, sha256 `77d9beff7dd7d688...` -- and `tests/test_sequence_description.py`
pins the rendering against the shared iterator so the coupling cannot drift.
