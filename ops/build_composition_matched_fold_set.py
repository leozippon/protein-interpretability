"""Build a composition-matched, fold-disjoint retrieval cohort -- or refuse to.

**Why this exists.** F10, F12 and D3.g each found a residue-statistics surrogate
matching or beating the model, and in D3.g a 3-mer frequency surrogate
out-retrieved a 7B model by 2.6x on that model's own protein mode. The common
property of all three measurements is that they were read on *agreement* sets:
cohorts where evolutionary sequence statistics and biological structure predict
the same neighbour, so a model that replayed corpus statistics and a model that
learned structure are observationally identical. No amount of further measuring
on an agreement set separates them.

This script constructs the disagreement set. Its unit is a **triple**

    (anchor, sequence partner, structure partner)

where the sequence partner is matched to the anchor on amino-acid composition --
tightly enough that composition cannot tell them apart at the lengths involved --
while carrying a *different* fold, and the structure partner carries the anchor's
own fold while being as far from it in sequence space as the pool allows. A
completion of the anchor's prefix that follows the sequence partner is a
statistics result; one that follows the structure partner is a structure result.
The triple is admitted only when the two spaces genuinely disagree about which
target is nearest, so the two hypotheses make opposite predictions on every
admitted record. That is the contradiction the impasse requires, and building it
is the whole of this script's job: **it fits nothing, runs no model, and licenses
no claim about any model.**

**What "matched" means, and why it is not an absolute tolerance.** Composition is
estimated from a finite sequence, so at length L it cannot be measured more
finely than multinomial sampling noise. Two independent draws of the *same*
composition at L = 200 differ by a total-variation distance of about 0.17. An
absolute tolerance chosen without that reference is therefore either unattainable
or vacuous, which is the failure mode this programme has twice paid for. The
criterion here is a ratio against that null (:data:`COMPOSITION_MATCH_RATIO_MAX`):
an admitted pair must be *closer in composition than two independent samples of
one composition would be at its own two lengths*. The null is analytic and its
agreement with simulation is recorded in the manifest.

**Which k-mer, and why 2 rather than 3.** At 80-400 residues a tripeptide profile
holds L-2 counts spread over 8,000 cells, so its cosine is not a frequency
comparison at all: it is dominated by whichever few 3-mers two sequences happen
to share, which makes it a low-complexity and repeat detector. Measured on the
pool, the tripeptide cosine separates same-CATH-superfamily from
different-superfamily pairs at chance -- every manifest carries the figure as a
negative control -- and choosing a partner by it gives a composition match no
better than a random pair. The dipeptide profile holds L-1 counts over 400 cells
and is an estimate. Selection therefore runs on the dipeptide profile
(:data:`SEQUENCE_SPACE_KMER`) and the tripeptide profile is carried as a second
channel whose ordering is required and reported.

**The fold statistic is contact-map-derived and is calibrated before it is used.**
The obvious choice -- a coarse two-dimensional density of the contact map in
normalised sequence coordinates -- was tried first and is useless: it separates
CATH superfamilies at AUC 0.53, because it is dominated by the diagonal band
every protein shares. What does separate them is the **contact separation
spectrum**, the fraction of contacts falling in each log-spaced band of sequence
separation, concatenated with the CA-trace secondary-structure fractions this
repository already derives; the two together reach roughly 0.8-0.87 depending on
the pool, against a k-mer negative control at chance. CATH superfamily is an
externally curated structural label and is used both to calibrate the statistic
and, independently, as an admission criterion, so no triple rests on the proxy
alone. The calibration is recomputed and written into every manifest rather than
quoted from here, and ``--foldseek`` adds a per-pair TM-align check of what the
descriptor decided.

**Leakage is measured, not assumed.** Both partners are drawn only from records
that share no near-duplicate group with the anchor (the relation and threshold of
:mod:`src.transfer.near_duplicates`) and that DIAMOND does not align to it at all
at ``--evalue 1e-3``. L30 is why the record is not the unit: on a protein corpus
a record-level split is not a split. The realised identity of every triple leg is
reported at five boundaries off the same all-against-all alignment, beside the
threshold-free containment distribution, so the residual is a reading rather than
a claim.

**A refusal is a result.** If no threshold in the declared sweeps yields a cohort
that clears the floors, the manifest says so, carries the curves that show why,
and the run still completes: a measured "this cohort cannot support the estimand"
is the deliverable in that case, and is worth more than a cohort that fails a
gate after burning GPU hours. The verdict field is the place to read it.

Runs on the workstation and not in a pod: DIAMOND is the offline standard this
repository calibrates its alignment-free relations against and no aligner is
staged in a pod. Pass ``--diamond`` the path to an extracted
``external_resources/tools/diamond-linux64-*.tar.gz``.
