"""Plan and write the targeted three-depth extraction for the two depth-blocked gates.

Two subcommands.

``estimate`` needs no selection and answers the allocation question: what a
targeted extraction of each cohort would cost in GPU-hours and in retained-state
storage. The GPU figure does not depend on which depth is selected, because every
hooked block is read from the same forward pass, so it is the measured wall clock
of the extraction that already ran on that cohort. The storage figure is quoted
at three depths per arm, which is the upper bound.

``manifests`` needs the reassessment's own per-arm depth selection and refuses
without it. It writes one campaign lane per arm plus a plan record, and it marks
every lane **blocked** unless the extractor it names already accepts the depth
option: a lane naming an option its stage does not define is refused by argparse
with exit 2, which is how three of the four cells of the first full-width
retention dispatch were lost.

Nothing is dispatched here, and no model is loaded.

together with the two depths its own retained manifest records as admitted, so
the new cells are comparable with the published ones on the same arrays. An arm
whose selected depth is already one of those two hooks two rather than three,
and its lane names no extra depth.

Why a targeted set and not a stack: the representation extraction of this gate
hooked (L-1)//2 and L-1 only, so a depth selection other than those two cannot be
applied to it at all (audit L53). Capturing a third block costs the same single
forward pass per sequence, so the GPU cost is this cohort's own measured
extraction cost, {hours} GPU-hours over {arms} arms, and only the retained
storage grows, to {gib} GiB at the selected depths against 29.75 GiB at the two
admitted ones.

Cells are ordered longest-first by the measured wall clock of the same arm's
completed extraction, which reads a measured duration and no fitted outcome.
