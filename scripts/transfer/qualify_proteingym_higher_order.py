"""Support declaration and measurement-noise floor for the higher-order gate on ProteinGym.

Two stages, run in that order, because the endpoint has to be chosen on support
and power rather than on a label outcome.

``support`` reads the pinned ProteinGym raw archive, reconciles each raw assay
against the processed benchmark CSV by variant identifier and count, and declares
the complete-cube support: which orders carry cubes whose every non-empty subset
and whose wild-type corner are measured, and how many *site tuples* those cubes
rest on. Site tuples and assays are the independent units; a cube count is not a
sample size. No replicate value is read into the admission rule.

``noise-floor`` re-derives that support, refuses to proceed unless the declared
digest still matches, and then measures the order-k cycle separately in each
replicate channel. It reports the between-channel decomposition and, independently,
the floor propagated from the measured per-state channel dispersion: an order-k
cycle sums ``2 ** k`` corner estimates with unit weights, so if corner errors are
independent with standard deviation ``sigma`` the channel-difference standard
deviation is ``sqrt(2 ** (k + 1)) * sigma`` and the per-channel discordance is
``sqrt(2 ** k) * sigma``. Measured and propagated are both reported, because their
agreement is what establishes that the corner errors behave independently.

Scale and estimand. The channel value is ``log10(rep_i)``, the study's own
per-replicate brightness normalised by its block's wild-type mean, so the endpoint
is an order-k cycle in log10 brightness units. The raw file carries the wild-type
state that the processed CSV drops, so the cycle is wild-type-centred and absolute
on that scale rather than a within-assay centred residual. Nonadditivity on a
declared transformed assay scale is not by itself a molecular interaction, and the
floor is measured on the same scale as the endpoint so that the comparison is
internally consistent.

No model score, likelihood or representation enters any quantity here.
