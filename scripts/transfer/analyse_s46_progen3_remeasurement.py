"""The fifteen-checkpoint homologue-concordance/recognition correlation, remeasured.

The withdrawn coefficients (pooled -0.6107, low-overlap -0.5512) were computed
by ``manuscript_cross_result_analysis.py`` from the stage-46 expansion aggregate
and the unconditional-generation diversity census. Only the two ProGen3 rows of
that aggregate were affected by the sequence-ID defect, so this script replaces
exactly those two rows with the corrected stage-46 analyse output and recomputes
the same statistic over the same fifteen checkpoints.

It is a replacement, not a new analysis, so it reproduces the withdrawn
coefficients from the historical inputs first and refuses to report a corrected
value if that reproduction misses the recorded numbers. Everything else -- the
lineage map, the leave-one-lineage-out set, the recognition-rate definition and
the absence of a model-population interval -- is carried over unchanged.

CPU only. No model is loaded and nothing is resampled.
