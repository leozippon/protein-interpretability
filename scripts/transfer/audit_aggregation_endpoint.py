"""Audit the Zenodo 17477631 small-domain aggregation release as a candidate endpoint.

The release is Martell et al. 2025, *Global Analysis of Aggregation Determinants in
Small Protein Domains*, deposited at 10.5281/zenodo.17477631 under CC-BY-4.0. Its
endpoint is

    log2 fold change in soluble abundance = log2( mean normalised reporter-ion
    intensity after stress / mean normalised reporter-ion intensity in the paired
    unstressed control ),

dimensionless, more negative for more aggregation. It never sits beside a free
energy or a growth fitness, so nothing measured here may be pooled with the
kcal/mol stability gates or with a growth readout.

What this script measures, from the deposited files and never from the article:

* the library and replicate structure -- which reporter-ion channel carries which
  condition and which replicate, recovered by exact reproduction of the deposited
  per-condition means and standard deviations, and whether the deposited endpoint
  follows from those channels;
* the acidic-channel correction the release applies to Metagenomic 1, recovered as
  a slope and an intercept from the deposited corrected and uncorrected columns and
  refitted on the shared proteins, because what the correction was calibrated on
  decides whether the corrected channel's agreement is an independent measurement;
* the between-library channel decomposition on the proteins quantified in more than
  one library, with family groups as the resampling unit, both on the release's full
  shared set and on the support that survives exclusion of the sequences already
  held in the staged MGnify stability cohort;
* the quality-control support: the cysteine rule, the peptide counts, the
  quantification rates and the completeness of the reporter-ion channels.

The ratio of the shared-component standard deviation to the per-channel discordance
standard deviation is read against two comparators: the admitted folding-stability
endpoint's 3.86 [3.61, 4.13] and the disqualified MGnify stability endpoint's
1.566 [1.301, 1.847]. The ratio is dimensionless, so it compares across endpoints
whose units differ; the standard deviations themselves do not.

Every decomposition, interval, grouping contract and unit floor is imported from
``src.transfer`` rather than restated here.
