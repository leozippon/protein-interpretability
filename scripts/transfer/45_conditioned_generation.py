"""Does a conditioned arm generate what it is asked for? The native interface.

EXP-R2-227, track D1.h. **The first Objective-1 measurement in this programme
that samples from a model rather than scoring one.** Every prior Direction-1
reading is a likelihood, a context information or a rank correlation; nothing had
ever asked a generative model to generate.

Two panel-adjacent checkpoints carry a conditioning interface that was trained
into them and has never been exercised: ZymCTRL's EC tag, which L15 prices at
1.73 nats -- so it demonstrably moves the distribution, and **nobody has asked
whether it moves it in the requested direction** -- and ProLLaMA Stage 2's
`[Generate by superfamily]` instruction, declared in `joint_modes` and never run.

**This is not the retired steering line.** Audit 9.1 retires internal-feature EC
steering, which returned a measured 0/8 across three attempts. Nothing here
injects a feature, a direction or a coefficient: the intervention is the prompt
the model was trained to receive. `src.transfer.conditioned_generation.CEILING`
carries that distinction and the rest of the binding ceiling, and every artefact
this stage writes carries it too.

Five sub-stages, in the order the registration froze and for the reason it gives
-- generation is cheap relative to the oracles, so nothing about the ordering may
be relaxed to save time:

``--stage instruments``   build HMMER, verify Pfam-A against its published
                          digest, press it, and record CLEAN, ESMFold and
                          Foldseek availability BEFORE any generation exists.
``--stage queue``         the frozen class queue, drawn under seed 20260826 from
                          each arm's own admissible class list and pinned by a
                          content digest every later sub-stage verifies.
``--stage anchors``       the per-class instrument price -- real exemplars
                          against length-matched random UniRef50 -- and the
                          surviving cohort. A class that fails is removed here,
                          before any generation is scored.
``--stage generate``      the only GPU sub-stage: 200 samples per
                          (arm x class x condition) at one frozen sampling
                          configuration.
``--stage score``         the oracle, the near-duplicate grouping, the
                          class-clustered bootstrap and the compound.

CPU for everything except ``generate``. The HMMER/Pfam oracle, the InterPro
release and the UniRef50 corpus are staged on the workstation and not in the
pod, so the split is where the instruments are.
