"""Does InstructProtein's native family instruction move its generations toward the requested family?

A feasibility probe, not a campaign, and not a widening of EXP-R2-227. The
checkpoint's native conditioning interface was established from primary sources
before this script existed, and the first run was then re-run against the label
form and the scaffold those sources actually specify.

What the sources carry. The paper's Table 6, on the knowledge-instruction
dataset, gives its *Family Generation* row as ``Instruction: Can you provide me
with a protein belonging to the secretoglobin family? Output: Sure, here's a
protein from the secretoglobin family: {protein}.``, and its Figure 10 renders
four family-conditional de novo design prompts of the form ``Instruction: I would
like a protein that is in metallothionein family. Output:`` followed by the
design. The checkpoint's own repository is more precise than the paper about this
direction: its released benchmark driver ``benchmarks/scripts/run_scope_fold_rank.py``
instructs the released checkpoint with exactly

    Instruction: I would like a protein that is in {}.
\n\nOutput: One of the protein that meets the demand is

and its released toy instruction data (``dump/pretrain/raw/instructions.txt``)
carries 1,008 records in that form, every one with a lower-case prose family name
ending in the entry's own type noun (``family``, ``superfamily``, ``domain`` or
``site``), every one followed by the span ``<protein>ƤM...``. The label is
therefore a **prose family name** rather than an accession, and the template
carries an **assistant prefix** that the first run supplied no part of. That is
the request measured here.

The checkpoint emits text positions badly (EXP-R2-151: 92.8% of its probability
mass on the twenty residue tokens at every text position, a clean text NLL of
19.08 against ln(50304) = 10.83). That is a readout failure at text positions.
Here the instruction is **supplied by us and never sampled**: the prompt is the
checkpoint's own released instruction scaffold, and only the protein span is
generated.

One measurement is hard and one is soft. A hit at the release's gathering
threshold is the hard one and is a strict bar, so the score stage reports a
single secondary reading beside it: for every generation, its 5-mer Jaccard
similarity to the staged members of the requested family against its similarity
to the staged members of the mismatched family. It is labelled a soft read
everywhere, it gates nothing, and what it can and cannot establish is written
where it is reported.

One class, one contrast, n = 200 per cell:

* **requested** -- the prompt names class A and the generations are scored for A;
* **mismatched** -- the prompt names class B and the same generations are scored
  for A.

Both cells are one arm, one sampling configuration and one oracle. The oracle is
EXP-R2-227's own: HMMER 3.4 against the pressed Pfam-A release at the release's
gathering thresholds, with the class's Pfam referent derived exactly as that
campaign derives it -- from a disjoint referent draw of the class's own real
Swiss-Prot exemplars, never from the anchor draw and never from a generation.
The per-class instrument anchor (real exemplars against length-matched random
UniRef50) runs **before any generation is scored**, as that campaign requires.

A low hit rate is only readable if the oracle recognises the class at all, which
is what the anchor prices. The class's exemplars are identified by the staged
`protein2ipr`-derived Pfam span table, so the anchor's real side partly
re-establishes the labelling channel rather than pricing class specificity from
an independent channel; that limitation is recorded per class and carried in the
report rather than papered over.

Stages, in order:

``--stage class``      the eligible family census and the seeded draw of the
                       requested and mismatched classes. No GPU, no oracle.
``--stage anchor``     the per-class instrument price, through HMMER and Pfam-A.
``--stage generate``   the only GPU stage: 200 + 200 samples at one frozen
                       configuration, with the generated ids kept.
``--stage score``      the oracle on the generations, the two rates, their
                       difference with an interval, and the residue accounting.

The oracle is staged host-locally and is not in the repository, so it is built
under ``--work`` unless it is already there: if ``--work/hmmer`` and
``--work/pfam`` already hold a built HMMER and a pressed Pfam-A -- a symlink to
an existing build is enough -- nothing is rebuilt. The repository's own
``conditioned_generation`` module supplies the classifier: the class draw, the
referent derivation, the anchor record, the near-duplicate grouping, the rate
contrast and the frozen sampling constants are all imported from it rather than
restated here.

Re-run:

    python scripts/transfer/instructprotein_family_generation_probe.py --stage class
    python scripts/transfer/instructprotein_family_generation_probe.py --stage anchor
    python scripts/transfer/instructprotein_family_generation_probe.py --stage generate --device cuda:4 --dtype bfloat16
    python scripts/transfer/instructprotein_family_generation_probe.py --stage score
