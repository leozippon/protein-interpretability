"""Check that a depth-resolved archive holds the admitted four blocks unchanged.

The hooking loop in :func:`~src.transfer.readout_extraction.extract_batch` has no
test in this repository, because exercising it needs a loaded checkpoint. Its
order is preserved by construction -- the admitted pair is hooked first and its
captures are concatenated first -- but construction-preserving arguments are what
this programme has learned not to trust at face value, and if that order moved
every archive in a depth sweep would be silently wrong while looking well formed.

So this compares a newly written depth-resolved archive against the already
retained two-depth archive of the same arm, background by background, and
requires the admitted four block summaries to be **byte-identical**. It reads
only the two archive sets and the arm's block count; it loads no model, fits
nothing and resamples nothing.

A depth-resolved archive writes one array per hooked block, ``features_d<index>``
of shape ``(rows, 2, width)`` holding that block's mean and last summaries. The
admitted archive writes a single ``features`` of shape ``(rows, 4, width)``, whose
four slices are the middle block's two summaries then the final block's two. So
the admitted view of a depth archive is the two arrays named for the arm's
admitted block indices, concatenated in that order, and that is what must match.

    python scripts/transfer/verify_depth_archive_identity.py \
      --arm gpt2-large --blocks 36 \
      --depth-dir <wave>/depth3-gpt2-large \
      --admitted-dir <retained wave>/full-gpt2-large \
      --out logs/d1_recomputation_20260924/gate_identity_gpt2-large.json

Exit status is 0 only if every compared background is byte-identical. Anything
else is a defect in the shared hooking rule and not a tolerance to widen.
