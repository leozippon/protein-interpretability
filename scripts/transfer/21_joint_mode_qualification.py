"""Is one joint language-protein checkpoint measurable in BOTH of its modes?

D1.d asks which differences remain when text and protein modes share one
checkpoint, and it admits nothing until **one dense joint decoder is qualified in
both modes**. This stage is that qualification, and it is an external baseline
rather than a panel measurement: ``--checkpoint`` names a directory, not an arm,
because a checkpoint that has not passed this stage must not be in ``arms.py`` at
all.

**Estimand, one per mode.** Context information: the held-out unigram
cross-entropy on the scored symbols minus the model's own clean cross-entropy on
the same symbols. It is stage 01's estimand deliberately -- a joint checkpoint's
qualification has to be commensurable with the panel's -- and it carries stage
01's reading with it: a mode below the floor is **unmeasurable on that cohort**,
not failing. That distinction is the whole verdict. It says the evaluation
interface cannot resolve anything on this cohort, and it says nothing about what
the checkpoint knows.

**The published verdict is a pre-interval screen, not the identification
criterion.** The floor is
:data:`src.transfer.budget.SCREENING_CONTEXT_INFORMATION_NATS` -- the point rule
EXP-R2-218 calibrated against a known-zero null family at FPR <= 0.05 -- and it
answers "does this reading justify an interval". Identification itself is
:func:`src.transfer.budget.context_identification`, which reads the mode's
displacement-corrected bootstrap interval; this stage computes no bootstrap, so
it persists the per-record sufficient statistics into ``records/`` and
``41_context_information_bootstrap.py`` takes the verdict from them. The
difference is not hypothetical: on the EXP-R2-220 cells the screen refuses
``galactica-1.3b``'s protein mode at +0.047678 and the criterion identifies it,
its corrected interval reaching down only to +0.038694 (EXP-R2-221, §5.10). The 0.30 nats this
stage used to gate on was never derived; it is now an inert column
(``legacy_qualification_floor_nats``, ``clears_legacy_qualification_floor``)
that admits and refuses nothing, declared once as
:data:`src.transfer.budget.MIN_CONTEXT_INFORMATION_NATS` and no longer restated
here. Old and new artefacts are not confusable: an artefact written before the
change carries ``modes[*].verdict`` and ``verdicts`` decided at 0.30 under
schema ``...qualification_v1``; one written after carries
``modes[*].identification_verdict`` and ``identification_verdicts`` decided at
0.05 under ``...qualification_v2``, and no key means two things across the pair.

**What "this mode is not worth a behavioural read" rests on is the reversal
cost, and it is not a threshold.** Every protein record already carries
``controls.reversed.cost_nats_per_residue``, and that -- not a context-information
floor -- is the substantive evidence: ``Llama-2-7b-hf`` pays **-0.0013**
nats/residue to have a sequence reversed, which is indifference to reading
direction, against **+0.1442** for the adapted stage.
:data:`src.transfer.concept_alignment.PROTEIN_MODE_BEHAVIOURAL_STATUS` already
states the refusal in exactly those terms. The cost is **reported and never
gated**, because pairing every published protein reading with its own reversal
cost shows the two orderings cross: the refused chimera families
``s1Body_baseVocab`` and ``s1Body_baseHead`` read -0.061 to -0.085 nats of
context information at reversal costs of +0.119 to +0.138, overlapping the
+0.136 to +0.167 of the admitted ProLLaMA-lineage cells -- ``s1Body_baseHead``
on the second draw pays +0.1379 and is refused while ``s1Body_baseEmbed`` pays
+0.1358 and is admitted -- while ``galactica-125m`` reads -0.139 at +0.088. A
reversal-cost criterion would be a **different partition**, not a tightening of
this one, and would change admissions in both directions. Both quantities are
published; neither is turned into a second gate.

**Per-record sufficient statistics are persisted, so uncertainty is a CPU job.**
Beside the report, each measured mode writes ``records/power_<cohort>_<digest>``
``.records.npz`` in ``budget.write_power_records``'s format, with the frozen
scored cohort and the frozen held-out reference beside it. It holds the
per-record clean-NLL sums, token counts, symbol counts and sparse target counts
of the declared **and** the reversed condition, which is everything a
group-clustered bootstrap of this stage's own point estimates needs. This stage
publishes point estimates with no interval, and that is the defect the sidecar
exists to let a later analysis close without a second GPU sweep.

**What one scored symbol is, is the family's declaration.** Galactica and
InstructProtein reach a per-residue alphabet, so a protein symbol is a residue and
the magnitude is in nats per residue. ProLLaMA does not -- ``Seq=<...>`` over the
unmodified LLaMA-2 vocabulary merges residue runs, and that merged form is what
the lineage was trained on -- so its protein symbol is a token. The estimand
follows the declared unit rather than the other way round: the unigram support,
the clean cross-entropy's denominator and the reported unit all move together.

That mobility is exactly why every protein record carries its **measured residues
per scored token** and an explicit cross-arm comparability verdict. A magnitude in
nats per token is not commensurable with one in nats per residue, and it is not
commensurable with another arm's nats per token either when the arms differ in
residues per token (Appendix B rule 26, limitation L23). The artefact says so in
its own field rather than leaving a reader to notice.

**The unigram is held out and its support is declared.** It is fitted on a draw
that is disjoint from the scored one by construction (a later window of the same
seeded permutation) and then deduplicated by content, because Swiss-Prot carries
the same sequence under several accessions (Appendix B rule 3). Its support is
always the set of ids a scored target of that mode can take -- and that set is
read from ``joint_modes``, so it follows the declared symbol unit: the twenty
residue ids for a residue-unit family, every residue-spelling token (463 on the
staged LLaMA-2 vocabulary) for a token-unit one, and the model's whole vocabulary
for text. Laplace smoothing inflates a cross-entropy by roughly ``log(1 + s*V/N)``,
and on the 41682-target ProLLaMA reference this stage's defaults draw that is
0.0005 nats over twenty symbols, 0.011 over 463 and 0.570 over the full 32000 --
so fitting a protein reference over the whole vocabulary would put more smoothing
bias into the baseline than the effect being measured.

**Controls, because the headline number alone cannot be read.**

``reversed``      the same sequences scored backwards under the same rendering. A
                  decoder carrying real directional sequence structure cannot be
                  indifferent to reversal, so a small reversal cost is what
                  distinguishes "this cohort is hard" from "this mode is not
                  reading the sequence at all". It is a within-arm difference over
                  an identical residue multiset, which is why it survives the unit
                  problem above and why the reading of a protein mode rests on it
                  rather than on the floor: the cost is read **per residue** in
                  both units. It is reported, never gated -- see above. For a token-unit
                  family that is also the only readable form -- reversal permutes
                  the residues but not the tokenisation, so the reversed condition
                  is a different token population and neither a per-token cost nor
                  the forward reference applies to it.
``naive``         the same sequences under the rendering with the per-residue
                  escape removed -- what an unaided ``AutoTokenizer`` call
                  produces. It prices the rendering (Appendix B rule 4) in the
                  estimand's own per-residue units, and it is the one measurement
                  in this stage that is deliberately not verified against the
                  per-residue alphabet. **Withheld with its reason** for a family
                  that declares no escape: there "the escape removed" is the
                  declared rendering itself, the price is zero by construction,
                  and no substitute control is invented.
``residue_mass``  the model's probability mass on its residue tokens at every
                  scored TEXT position, where the family declares a residue
                  subspace disjoint from text. This is what identifies a
                  *collapsed* text mode -- a model treating arbitrary prose as
                  the prefix of a protein -- rather than merely a bad number.
                  Withheld with its reason where the residues are ordinary
                  letters of the text vocabulary, because there the statistic
                  would be a fact about twenty capital letters.

The rendering itself is declared in ``src.transfer.joint_modes`` and nowhere else
(Appendix B rule 12); this file names a family and reads the rest from there.
