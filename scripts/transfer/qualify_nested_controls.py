"""Qualify one nested gate's controls before any model quantity is read.

This entry point serves both cohorts the nested machinery fits -- the Domainome
external confirmation and the MGnify remote-homology gate -- because the
weighting, the folds, the ridge recipe, the candidate order and the qualification
rule are one declaration shared by the two, and only the endpoint's unit and its
strata differ. The cohort's own schema names which it is.

A control may enter a capability comparison only if it is a competent predictor
of held-out family groups in its own right. Each candidate is offered, in the
declared order, to the standing set that has already qualified, and it is kept
only if its paired reduction in group-equal held-out mean squared error over that
standing set is positive at every prespecified split seed. A candidate that
lowers it is discarded and reported, never carried forward.

**Each candidate's own contribution is reported with an interval, and the
qualified set's own contribution over the no-effect null is reported with one
too.** That is not decoration: a control whose own contribution is
indistinguishable from zero makes any increment measured over it uninformative,
which is the failure the limitations catalogue records as L48 with four
instances. A block kept by the three-seed sign rule whose own interval contains
zero is reported as exactly that.

No model likelihood, representation or score is read here, so the qualified set
cannot be a function of a model outcome.
