"""Freeze the qualification of the three newly staged endpoints.

Acquisition alone leaves an endpoint unusable. Each of these three is declared
here to the standard the admitted endpoints met: a construction and sign
convention written out rather than implied, a noise floor measured from whatever
replicate or channel structure the source carries, support counted in
independent units rather than rows, and an explicit statement of what the
endpoint licenses and what it does not.

The authored half -- construction, unit definition and scope -- lives in this
file. The measured half is read from the two reports that produced it, so no
quantity is retyped: ``census_endpoint_support.py`` supplies the counts and the
replicate, channel and between-reference floors, and
``measure_endpoint_remoteness.py`` supplies the identity bands and group counts.
The written declaration is digested so a later reading can be bound to it.

No gate is built here and no model quantity is read against any endpoint.

        "admission_rule": "every one of the three reported 95% interval widths -- trypsin, chymotrypsin and combined -- no wider than 0.5 kcal/mol, which is the tightened per-channel rule the staged stability cohort already applies rather than a new one",
