"""Assemble the declared-property table of the readout panel, then relate it to outcomes.

Why two subcommands rather than one. The panel holds 33 unconditioned arms and
8 of them carry a representation residual over the strongest control this
programme has measured. With that many properties and that few survivors, a
table built *after* looking at which arms survived would find a separating
property whatever the truth is. So ``properties`` builds the table from declared
checkpoint metadata alone, reads no fitted increment, and prints the SHA-256 of
its canonical JSON form; ``separate`` refuses to run unless the table it is
handed still hashes to the digest that was recorded before any outcome was
attached.

Every value is either read from an artifact, read from ``src.transfer.arms``, or
carried here as a literal transcribed from a repository record that is named in
:data:`PROSE_SOURCES`. Nothing is inferred from a model card this host cannot
read, and a property no record states is written ``not_recorded`` rather than
guessed: the whole point of the table is to say what the panel can and cannot
distinguish, and an invented cell would answer that question falsely.

CPU-only, seconds of work, no model load and no cohort draw.
