"""Check the Direction-1 manuscript against the derived-number table.

Reads ``manuscript/direction-one/`` read-only and refuses when any of the
following does not hold:

* **traceability** --- every number in the manuscript's prose, tables and
  captions resolves to an entry of the derived-number table, or to a declared
  non-evidence class (LaTeX geometry, template markup and the like);
* **one support per comparison** --- no two entries that differ only in their
  support are quoted in one sentence or one table row;
* **an interval carries its resampling unit** --- every interval in the
  manuscript resolves to an entry whose resampling unit and draw count are
  recorded, and the resampling unit is named in the manuscript;
* **a quantity carries its unit** --- every quantity resolves to an entry with a
  unit, and a unit that is not dimensionless is named where the quantity is
  quoted;
* **no bare point estimate** --- an estimate the table carries an interval for
  is not quoted without one;
* **an effective count names its convention** --- a Kish count is quoted only
  where the weighting it was computed under is named, because a count computed
  under a different weighting than its estimator applies is misleading even when
  it is close;
* **a provisional result is marked** --- a representation-level quantity is
  quoted only in a paragraph that says it is provisional.

Declared exceptions live in the policy file and each must name a live anchor in
the manuscript, so an exception cannot outlive the sentence it was written for.
The checker never edits the manuscript.
