"""Descriptive base → Stage 1 → Stage 2 comparison on the ProLLaMA lineage.

EXP-R2-226. This stage is CPU-only. It consumes existing stage-20 and stage-29
artefacts, this campaign's own per-rung qualification artefacts, and the
per-rung stage-41 reports the lineage was already qualified on. It loads no
model, downloads no weights and synthesises no cross-task total.

**What the axis is, and what it is not.** The ladder is a training *stage* axis:
one set of weights, adapted twice. F14 measured what the same three checkpoints
**lost** on a text task; this measures what they bought on the two frozen
protein-capability queues the repository already owns. Differences are
descriptive of these checkpoints. They are not identified as a causal effect of
"continued pretraining": the step that separates base from Stage 1 changes the
corpus, retrains ``embed_tokens`` and ``lm_head`` outright, and fixes a LoRA
rank, a schedule and a data order at once, so what a transition prices is the
released adaptation **as a whole**.

**The verdict label is** :data:`TRANSITION_LABEL`, deliberately not
``descriptive_gate_transition``. The arithmetic is EXP-R2-224's compound; that
label is reserved for adjacent rungs of a same-family *scale* ladder. The two
must never be pooled into one table of transitions, and a row from here may not
be counted alongside a ProGen2 rung transition.

**The two ladders do not pool, and that is enforced rather than asserted.**
Three independent refusals stand between them. The rung list is fixed at this
lineage's three names. The DMS census is 217 assays over 174 families with an
**empty** context-exclusion set -- EXP-R2-224's ladder analyses 201 over 163
because 16 assays overflow ProGen2's 1024 positions, and this lineage's longest
wild type renders to 2231 tokens against 4096 -- so a ProGen2 payload cannot
satisfy this campaign's census. And every payload must declare the **token** as
its scored symbol unit: this family's summed log-likelihood is over merged
multi-residue SentencePiece pieces and a residue-unit family's is over single
residues, which is a different scoring functional even on a common support.

**The ladder's length is decided by the qualification and not by a result.** If
Stage 2 fails a clause, the reported ladder is base → Stage 1, the Stage 1–Stage
2 pair is not formed, and the failure is reported with the clause that fired.
The instruction rendering is never fallen back to in order to recover it. If
Stage 1 fails, the campaign stops entirely: the base rung alone is not a ladder
and its solitary reading is not published as a capability measurement.
