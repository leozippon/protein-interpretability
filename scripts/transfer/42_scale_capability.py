"""Descriptive ProGen2 medium→large→xlarge comparison. Not a causal scale claim.

This stage is CPU-only. It consumes existing stage-20 and stage-29 artefacts
and a full stage-41 report. It does not load a model, does not download
weights, and does not synthesise a cross-task total.

The comparison is fixed as progen2-medium → progen2-large → progen2-xlarge.
Checkpoint differences are descriptive of those checkpoints. They are not a
parameter-count causal effect: corpus identification is a model-favouring bound
on UniRef90+BFD30, and nothing here is a claim about biological knowledge.

A run that cannot qualify all three rungs on the same stage-41 blocks does not
emit DMS or MegaScale gates.

Two cohorts here are narrower than the queues they come from, and both are
recorded rather than implied. ProteinGym declares 217 substitution assays over
174 families; 16 of them render longer than the 1024-position context every
ProGen2 rung shares, so the ladder is read on the 201 assays over 163 families
that every rung can score. MegaScale scores all 146 designs; F12's design census
is the 130 certified zero-hit designs, and that flag is carried by the stage-29
cohort rather than by the per-arm payloads.

The freeze lives here and the arithmetic lives in
:mod:`src.transfer.scale_comparison`. Every rung name, census count, seed and
resample count below is this campaign's declaration and is checked here; the
paired resampling, the cohort alignment and the stage-41 qualification are one
implementation shared with the second-stage campaign, because those two must not
be free to drift apart on exactly the operations that make them comparable.
