"""The uncertainty audit of context information, run over statistics already on disk.

``docs/CONTEXT_INFORMATION_UNCERTAINTY_PREREGISTRATION.md`` is the frozen analysis
plan and this stage is its executable form. It loads no model, touches no GPU and
reaches no cluster: everything below is arithmetic over the per-record sufficient
statistics ``01_cohort_power.py --record-statistics`` persists beside its report,
which is the whole point of that sidecar. A second sweep of the panel buys nothing
this file cannot compute.

What it produces, in the order the pre-registration declares it.

**A group-level paired interval for I per arm per cohort draw.** The resampling
unit is the near-duplicate group, one cohort draw feeds both terms of
``I = H_baseline - H_model``, the reference is resampled independently and the
smoothed unigram is refitted inside every iteration. All of that lives in
``src.transfer.information_bootstrap``; this stage's job is to assemble the arm
inputs honestly, and the one thing it must not do is invent a grouping. Group
assignments are not persisted on the base cohort path, so they are recomputed here
from the cohort records the companion ``cohort_*.json`` holds. Where those records
are unavailable the fallback to singleton groups is written into every affected
record as a declared limitation rather than applied quietly, because a
record-level interval is narrowest exactly where group dependence is strongest.

**The identification verdict, from the corrected interval rather than a floor.**
The interval a percentile bootstrap gives here is displaced upward by the reference
refit -- ``-log`` is convex, so resampling the reference lifts the drawn baselines
above the full-reference value -- and a lower-bound rule read off it passes 64 of
120 readings whose true information is zero. ``information_bootstrap`` now measures
that displacement separately and publishes the interval with it removed;
``budget.context_identification`` reads the corrected lower bound, and
``per_arm_identification_status`` is the verdict. The
``budget.SCREENING_CONTEXT_INFORMATION_NATS`` comparison is still reported, as
``screening_status``, and decides nothing here (EXP-R2-221,
``docs/DISPLACEMENT_CORRECTED_IDENTIFICATION_PREREGISTRATION.md``).

**Contrasts that respect where pairing is defined.** Arms sharing one cohort draw
are bootstrapped in one ``bootstrap_arms`` call under common resample indices, so
their contrast is formed inside the iteration. Arms on different cohorts have no
common resampling unit and go through ``unpaired_contrast`` with that fact
attached. The panel does not sit on one cohort -- text arms on OpenWebText,
ProtGPT2 and the residue-level ProGen2 arms on Swiss-Prot, ZymCTRL on the
EC-labelled draw -- so this distinction is the difference between a contrast and a
fiction. The ProGen2-base / ProGen2-medium pair is named explicitly and its sign
is tracked across every draw, because four readings of that gap exist on disk and
one of the four has the opposite sign.

**And a block is a cohort draw, not a file.** Which arms share a resample index is
decided by the two digests every sidecar carries -- the records that were scored,
and the held-out reference they were scored against -- and never by which producer
invocation wrote them down. ``Cohort.digest`` hashes the records themselves, so two
cohort items agreeing on it hold the same records in the same order. Items exist to
make invocations: ``--dtype float32`` is process-global, so ProGen2-medium is
declared as its own item and lands in its own file while scoring the very same
Swiss-Prot draw as ProGen2-base against the very same reference. Keying pairing on
the file would let that split -- an artefact of how the numbers were produced --
decide whether the one contrast the pre-registration names is paired, and would
widen it for a reason the estimand knows nothing about. Every supplied sidecar
carrying one pair of digests is therefore assembled into one block, and where the
record text is supplied the records are checked to be the same records rather than
merely the same hash. A sidecar recording no reference digest is never merged: an
unverifiable reference is not a shared one.

**The three sensitivities the plan asks for.** Between-block spread is reported
beside the within-block interval and never folded into it; below eight blocks it
is reported as a spread with its degrees of freedom and explicitly not as an
interval, which is what the K = 2 pairs on disk have already been misread as. The
alpha sweep is pure CPU here because smoothing is applied at analysis time from
the persisted reference counts, so the vocabulary-dependent smoothing bias whose
published figures were withdrawn as unreproducible is measured rather than quoted,
and carried beside its analytic bound ``log(1 + aV/R)``. The leakage-removed arm
drops every reference record sharing a 30-mer with a cohort record; the sidecar
carries no sequence text, so it runs only when the reference records are supplied
and is emitted as explicitly unavailable otherwise.

**A control whose true information is zero.** ``--unigram-null-control`` adds, to
every block, one synthetic arm per measurable real arm whose predictive
distribution *is* a smoothed unigram fitted on the held-out reference of a
different supplied block. Both terms of ``I`` are then unigram estimates of one
population from independent samples, so the true value is zero by construction
while the measured one carries the estimator's own noise and its
vocabulary-dependent smoothing constant. It is the only point in this artefact
where the eligibility criteria are watched at a value that is known rather than
estimated, and the pre-registration's reason for reporting the sign rule without
adopting it is a prediction about exactly this point. The control joins the
panel of the arm it is built from, under the same resample indices and through
the same ``bootstrap_arms`` call, so there is no second estimator to argue
about; the block supplying its distribution and the block supplying the baseline
are named in every record and a control that cannot be shown to have two
different references is refused rather than reported.

Nothing is omitted silently. An arm whose cohort has too few effective groups is
refused with the reason attached, an arm absent from every sidecar is named as
absent rather than left out of the table, and a sensitivity that could not be
computed says why.

The sign criterion is reported and is **not** evidence. It is expected to pass on
every arm, and the pre-registration explains why: I carries a smoothing bias that
grows with vocabulary size and that no bootstrap can touch, so the sign test is
safe exactly where it is redundant and unreliable exactly where it would decide
something. Every record carrying ``sign_status`` carries that beside it.

    Two schemes, because two different generalisations are at stake and the panel
    supplies a unit for each. Holding out a **cohort draw** asks whether a
    threshold derived on seven draws controls its error rate on an eighth, which
    is the sampling question. Holding out a **tokenisation class** asks whether a
    threshold derived without ever seeing a vocabulary controls its error rate on
    that vocabulary, which is the question a single constant in nats per token
    actually raises: the null's magnitude is set by the smoothing constant, and
    the smoothing constant is a property of the inventory.

    Holding out an *arm* is not among them, and the reason is measured rather
    than asserted: arms sharing a block and a vocabulary carry one and the same
    reading, so a fold that held out ``gpt2`` would leave four bit-identical
    copies of its held-out readings in the calibration fold and would report a
    generalisation it never tested. ``null_reading_equivalence`` reports the
    collapse it rests on.

    The cohort-draw scheme is run twice, once with the blocks coupled to the
    held-out one by the control rotation withheld from the calibration fold as
    well. A control borrows the *next* block's reference, so a held-out block's
    reading is a function of a calibration block's reference; the buffered
    variant is what says whether that coupling is carrying the result.

    An arm with no record at all is named here as ``ABSENT``. Four of the fifteen
    panel arms have never been through the held-out estimator, and an empty cell
    in a comparison table is read as a pass far more often than it is read as a
    gap; naming it is the only thing that stops that.
