"""EXP-R2-226's all-or-stop qualification gate for one rung of the ProLLaMA lineage.

**What this decides.** A rung of ``Llama-2-7b-hf`` -> ``ProLLaMA_Stage_1`` ->
``ProLLaMA`` is scored on the two frozen protein-capability queues only after
every clause of EXP-R2-226's qualification holds. Failure of any clause stops
that rung and every later rung that would pair with it. Nothing here is replaced
to recover a rung: not the probes, not the floor, not the rendering, not the
checkpoint.

Three of the four clauses need a card and are evaluated here:

1. **Strict load** at the campaign precision, with Transformers' loading
   diagnostics exposed. ``missing_keys``, ``unexpected_keys``,
   ``mismatched_keys`` and ``error_msgs`` must all be empty; a newly initialised
   head is unavailable, never a pass (L24). The refusal lives in
   :func:`src.transfer.joint_lineage.load_rung`, which is also what the two
   fitness stages load through, so a qualified rung and a scored rung cannot
   have been built differently.
2. **Fixed-sequence NLL self-check** under the bare ``Seq=<...>`` rendering, run
   twice at the campaign precision. The target ids must match exactly between
   the repeats, every value must be finite, and the maximum per-target absolute
   difference must be at most :data:`REPEAT_MAX_ABS` nats.
3. **Directional-reversal control** under the same bare rendering, on the
   **adapted rungs only**. Reversing the residue order must cost strictly more
   than :data:`REVERSAL_COST_MIN` nats per scored token.

The fourth clause -- context information identified by the EXP-R2-221
displacement-corrected rule -- is **reused, not redrawn**, from the stage-21
re-analysis this repository already holds. It needs no card and no model, so it
is not evaluated here; ``44_adaptation_stage_capability.py`` reads it off that
artefact and refuses a ladder whose rungs do not carry it.

**The base rung enters as a declared floor, not as a qualified protein arm.**
Clause 3 is deliberately not applied to ``llama-2-7b``: its measured reversal
cost is -0.0013 nats per scored token, which is what an unadapted text decoder
on protein should look like -- no directional reading of sequence at all. It is
qualified so the ladder has a pre-adaptation reference, and a correlation it
returns is what these queues yield without a directional reading. It is never a
protein capability.

One rung per invocation, one artefact per rung, because this gate stops the rung
rather than the campaign. What each rung's failure costs the campaign is
EXP-R2-226's declaration and is applied where the ladder is assembled: Stage 2
failing leaves the ladder as base -> Stage 1, and Stage 1 failing stops the
campaign entirely because the base rung alone is not a ladder.
