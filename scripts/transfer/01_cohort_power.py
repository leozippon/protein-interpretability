"""Qualify an evaluation cohort before anything scientific is measured on it.

The cohort is built once, frozen by content hash, and then scored arm by arm for
the information the model commits relative to its own context-free baseline. An
arm below the threshold is reported as unmeasurable *on this cohort*: that is a
property of the evaluation set, not evidence about the model or about any
interpretability method, and downstream analyses must exclude the arm rather
than report a negative result from it.

Three artefacts, and the third is what makes this stage re-analysable. Beside
the frozen cohort and the report, ``--record-statistics`` (on by default) writes
``power_<cohort>_<digest>.records.npz``: the per-record clean-NLL sums, token
counts, symbol counts and target-token counts the report's figures are computed
from. Every published figure here is a function of those and of the reference
corpus's token counts, so a bootstrap, a re-weighting or a change of estimator
is a CPU job over that file rather than a second sweep of the panel. The report
carries the file's name and digest under ``sufficient_statistics``; a reader
that predates it finds ``null`` there and is otherwise unaffected.

A held-out run writes a fourth, ``reference_<cohort>_<reference digest>.json``:
the records of the block the context-free baseline was fitted on, frozen exactly
the way the scored cohort is. The sidecar deliberately carries no sequence text,
so without this file a re-analysis can neither group the reference by
near-duplicate content nor decide whether a reference record shares a k-mer with
a scored one -- the two things ``41_context_information_bootstrap.py`` needs and
reports as explicitly unavailable when they are missing. A plug-in run fits no
reference and writes no such file.

``--token-shuffle-control-seed`` turns the run into E3's negative control: each
record's scored target tokens are permuted within that record before the model
sees them, which destroys sequential context and leaves the unigram baseline
exactly unchanged. It is off unless it is asked for, and when it is asked for the
report is written under its own filename, declares itself under a different
``artifact`` name, and carries a ``negative_control`` block at the top and inside
every arm's record. Read
:class:`src.transfer.scoring.TargetTokenShuffle` before quoting a number from
one: the control bounds what a context-free predictor achieves on shuffled
input, which is not the same as an arm whose true context information is zero.
