"""EXP-R2-225 interface qualification. Not a panel stage and not a capability claim.

The sibling of ``scale_interface_qualification.py``, and a sibling rather than a
parameterisation of it. That stage's constants -- the 74-residue probe and its
SHA-256, the ``"1"``/``"2"`` direction-marker pair, the scoring-target support of
32 and the three frozen live widths -- are ProGen2-lineage facts. None of them is
true of a Qwen2.5 rung or of RITA, and a stage that took them as arguments would
be a stage whose frozen numbers live at its call site, which is the one property
an all-or-stop gate must not have. So this file freezes its own.

**What EXP-R2-225 asks of a checkpoint before it may be scored**, and what is
implemented here, clause by clause:

1. *Strict load.* ``load_arm_spec(..., strict=True)`` refuses any missing,
   unexpected, mismatched or error-reported key, and the counts it verified are
   recorded on the arm. An arm that arrives without them is refused rather than
   recorded as a clean load on no evidence -- the L24 silent-random-head failure
   is what that clause exists for.
2. *Native rendering as trained, scored positions identified, output semantics
   verified.* The probe is rendered through ``Cohort.input_strings``, so the
   rendering is the panel's declaration and not this stage's (Appendix B rule 12).
   Every scored target id is required to lie inside the arm's declared
   scoring-target alphabet, and the live output width is required to equal this
   campaign's frozen declaration for that checkpoint.
3. *A fixed NLL self-check and a negative control that makes NLL substantially
   worse.* The native probe is scored twice and must repeat to
   :data:`REPEAT_MAX_ABS` nats; the control is a frozen **anagram** of the probe
   -- the same symbols in a different order -- and its mean NLL must exceed the
   native mean by more than :data:`SHUFFLE_COST_MIN` nats per scored target.
4. *An unavailable checkpoint is reported unavailable, never substituted.*
   :data:`DECLARED_UNAVAILABLE` names each one with the measured reason, resolved
   before anything is loaded.

**One arm per invocation.** EXP-R2-224's qualification is all-or-stop across
three rungs in one process because that campaign's ladder is one lineage and a
rung that cannot be read invalidates the pair it belongs to. EXP-R2-225 says the
opposite in its own words -- "Failure of any clause stops **that arm**... no
other arm is moved into the vacant slot" -- so the unit here is the arm, and each
one is a separate cell that can fail without touching another's card.

**What is qualified elsewhere, named rather than omitted.** Two of this
campaign's waves do not come through this door and must not be given a second,
weaker one:

* ProGen3 (112M and 3B) qualifies through
  :func:`src.transfer.progen3.self_check`, which is a stronger check of exactly
  this shape -- a frozen sequence set, a per-checkpoint band measured on that
  checkpoint, and three recorded corruptions including the strict-clean wrong
  expert mapping that no ``load_state_dict`` can see. ``20_retrieval_bound.py``
  runs it before it scores anything.
* The joint wave (``facebook/galactica-{1.3b,6.7b,30b}``) qualifies through
  ``21_joint_mode_qualification.py``, which is the stage EXP-R2-225 means by
  "joint checkpoints qualify each mode separately" and which carries the
  directional reversal control the prereg requires of a protein mode. Galactica
  is reached by path and is declared as an arm nowhere, so it cannot reach
  :func:`load_arm_spec` and this stage's route does not exist for it.

A PASS says the frozen loader, the output interface and a negative control are
usable at the precision it was run at. It is not panel admission, not protein or
text capability, not a scale transition, not mechanism evidence, and not
biological knowledge.
