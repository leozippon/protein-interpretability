"""EXP-R2-225's descriptive second-stage comparison. Not a causal scale claim.

CPU only. It consumes existing stage-20 and stage-41 artefacts, loads no model,
downloads no weights, and synthesises no cross-task total.

Stage 42's sibling, and a sibling for the same reason
``second_stage_interface_qualification.py`` is one: the *freeze* belongs to the
campaign that made it. Every rung name, wave, census and stratum below is
EXP-R2-225's own declaration and is checked here. The arithmetic underneath --
the paired resampling, the cohort alignment, the stage-41 qualification, the
uniform-precision and uniform-stratum checks -- is
:mod:`src.transfer.scale_comparison`, one implementation shared with EXP-R2-224,
because the two campaigns must not be free to drift apart on exactly the
operations that make them commensurable. The group bootstrap is not restated
either: ``resamples`` and ``seed`` are imported from ``42_scale_capability.py``,
where the pre-data amendment that freezes them for both experiments put them.

**Three waves, one label rule.** ``descriptive_gate_transition`` is reserved for
**same-family adjacent rungs** and exists only as the unique compound block of
the EXP-R2-224 pre-data amendment. A cross-family row cannot receive it, and
neither can ProteinGLM or RITA, which report existence only. Auxiliary intervals
-- a per-rung raw Spearman, a MODEL - BLOSUM62, a context-information curve --
are reported and are not gates. :func:`require_label_eligible` is that rule as a
refusal rather than as a sentence.

**What this stage does not build, and why that is the point.** Two endpoints
EXP-R2-225's text licenses have no code path here, and each is declared as
unreachable with its reason rather than given a gate no artefact can feed:

* **MegaScale, on every wave.** The only pure-protein wave is ProGen3, which
  ``29_designed_referent.py`` refuses through
  ``designed_referent.EXCLUDED_ARMS`` because its published scoring convention is
  bidirectional -- a different estimand from the summed left-to-right
  log-likelihood every arm in that stage is read under. That refusal's ground is
  EXP-R2-225's own strata rule, which read against the prereg's "ProteinGym and
  MegaScale are entered ... by pure-protein arms" left a conflict the
  2026-08-26 pre-data amendment has since settled: the ground stands, its scope
  narrows to refusing ProGen3 in the same reading as the N-to-C arms, and the
  row becomes a **future** deliverable conditional on three things that do not
  exist. EXP-R2-225 delivers no MegaScale row on any wave, so this stage builds
  no gate for one.
* **ProteinGym and MegaScale on Galactica protein mode.** No code path reaches
  either: Galactica is declared as an arm nowhere and is reachable only through
  ``21_joint_mode_qualification.py --checkpoint <dir> --rendering galactica``,
  which measures context information rather than fitness. Stages 20 and 29 both
  resolve an ``ArmSpec`` by name and would refuse it.

A wave therefore carries only the endpoints it can actually be fed, and
:data:`NOT_DELIVERABLE` says so in the artefact.
