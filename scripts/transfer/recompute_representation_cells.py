"""Refit published representation cells at a selected readout class and depth.

Three subcommands, in the order they are used.

``plan`` joins a cell roster with the readout reassessment's per-arm selection and
reports which cells can run and which cannot, before any array is read. A cell is
refused when its gate fitted no representation design, when the gate's retained
artefacts cannot serve the selection kind, when no adapter loads that gate's
cells, or when its published report is not where the roster says. Refusing at
plan time is the point: which gates need a fresh extraction is a property of the
retention declaration and should be learned from it rather than from a
half-finished campaign.

``replay`` is the pipeline-identity control and is the only subcommand that runs
before the reassessment lands. It refits one cell at the **admitted** selection
from the retained states and requires the published held-out predictions back
inside the tolerance the admitted admission receipt declares, on identical
support, folds, seeds, weighting and label budget. A cell that fails it raises.

``run`` is the recomputation. It refuses without the reassessment's own selection
declaration, because a recomputation against a default selection would report an
increment that no reassessment chose.
