"""Conditions that must always hold for the ProteinGym higher-order cube support.

The contrast itself is :func:`src.transfer.higher_order_cycle.cycle_contrast`,
already fixed by ``tests/test_higher_order_cycle.py``; what is new here is the
ProteinGym addressing of it, the lower-order completeness requirement that decides
which variants carry a cycle at all, and the two-channel decomposition that
qualifies the endpoint.

One condition the gate would need is not instantiable and is recorded as absent
rather than satisfied: a held-out-label leakage test on a fitted readout. The
endpoint did not clear its measured noise floor, so no readout was fitted and no
model quantity was read. The leakage-adjacent property that *does* exist here is
tested instead -- the admitted support is a function of the measured state keys
and never of their values -- because that is the condition which, if it broke,
would let a label decide which cubes exist.
