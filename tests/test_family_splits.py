"""Ways a family-disjoint split could be wrong and say it was right.

Each test corresponds to a failure this component exists to make impossible
rather than to a line of its implementation:

* a family straddling the split -- the ``family_disjoint=True`` that was a field
  rather than a property (§0.05 of the audit);
* a multi-domain protein splitting a family through its second domain, which a
  "one dominant family per protein" rule cannot see;
* an unannotated protein being treated as unrelated to everything, which turns a
  gap in the label table into a licence to split anywhere;
* a cohort dominated by one family reporting a 50/50 split that is 95/5;
* a side carrying one family supporting a claim about unseen families;
* the label table's format moving under a reader that skips what it cannot parse;
* a similarity audit whose reference population is whatever came first in the
  file, which is Appendix B rule 1 arriving inside a control.
