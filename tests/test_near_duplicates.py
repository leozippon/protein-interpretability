"""What the near-duplicate grouping must get right for a split to be a split.

The property being protected is narrow and the failure it prevents is silent. A
stage fits a map on one split and reports it on another; if a held-out record has
a near-copy on the training side, the number reported is partly a number about
the training side, and nothing in the artefact looks wrong. On the Swiss-Prot
pool the model-diffing stage draws, that is not a corner case -- 41.4% of held-out
records have a relative at 95% identity or above and only 17.4% are exact, so an
exact-string check leaves most of it in place.

Four things therefore have to hold, and each of them can be false while the
grouping still returns a plausible-looking partition.

**Near-duplicates end up in one group.** Identical records, a record contained in
a longer one, and a record with scattered substitutions are all the same unit.

**Unrelated records do not.** A relation that joins everything is not a relation:
it produces one group, no split exists, and the stage refuses for a reason that
has nothing to do with the corpus. This is the failure mode of shingling *English*
by character rather than by word, and it is tested rather than reasoned about.

**No group is ever divided.** This is the whole point of splitting by group, and
it is checked on the returned mask rather than trusted from the construction.

**A pool that cannot be split refuses.** Whole groups are indivisible, so a pool
dominated by one of them has no split at the requested fraction. The honest
outcome is a loud refusal naming the group's size; a quieter one would report a
fraction it did not achieve.
