"""What the corpus k-mer background must get right to be worth counting.

The background exists to answer one objection: that a protein decoder scoring a
homologue-free referent above chance is reproducing corpus fragment statistics.
An objection is only answered by a number that is right, and three ways of
getting it wrong all produce a number that looks right.

**A k-mer that spans two records.** Concatenating 60 million records and sliding
a window over the join produces fragments that exist in no protein, and they are
systematically unusual because they join a C-terminus to an N-terminus. This is
the invariant the whole count rests on and it is checked directly, by requiring
that a fragment which exists *only* across a boundary is never counted.

**A k-mer that is dropped at a line break.** The natural way to buy the first
property is to treat the newline as an invalid symbol -- and that also discards
every window spanning FASTA line wrapping, one in twenty at k = 3 on a
60-column file. Those are real windows of real proteins. The test that catches
it wraps a record and requires the counts to equal the unwrapped record's.

**A k-mer lost or double-counted at a chunk boundary.** The corpus does not fit
in memory. A chunk boundary is not a record boundary, and a carry bug moves the
count by a few parts in a million -- far too little to notice and quite enough to
matter if the background is ever the thing a positive result is defended
against. The test runs one file at chunk sizes from a single byte upward and
requires every count to be identical.

Two smaller properties are checked because they are cheap and silent: header text
is protein-shaped and must contribute nothing, and a non-canonical residue must
drop every window containing it rather than being folded into a neighbour.
