"""E3's within-record token-shuffle control: what it must preserve, and when.

The control exists because neither eligibility criterion has ever been exercised
near its boundary -- the panel jumps from -4.08 nats on ``dialogpt-small`` to
+1.06 on ``progen2-base`` -- and its whole justification is one invariance: the
permutation must leave each record's *target* multiset exactly as it found it,
so that the unigram baseline every context-information figure is measured
against does not move at all. That invariance is proved here rather than
asserted, on both masking rules and with padding present, together with the
three properties that make a control artefact readable: the permutation is
reproducible from its seed alone, it is off unless it is asked for, and a run
under it cannot be mistaken for or overwrite a measurement.

The last test is the one that says the control does anything: a real GPT-2 on
real prose, scored twice on one cohort, whose clean cross-entropy rises towards
the unigram baseline while the baseline itself does not move by a bit.
