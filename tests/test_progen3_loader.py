"""The ProGen3 loader, tested where it can actually go wrong.

``ProGen3ForCausalLM.from_pretrained(path, moe_implementation="eager")`` returns
a model whose every expert and router is random, without raising: the released
weights are in megablocks packing and carry no key the eager block recognises.
``src.transfer.progen3`` exists to make that impossible, and the four things
that could let it back in are tested here.

**The mapping.** A wrong expert mapping still produces a state dict that loads
with ``strict=True``, so nothing structural catches it. Two tests cover it: the
conversion is exactly invertible, and the converted per-expert weights compute
the same function as the packed ones under the megablocks reference math -- and
stop doing so the moment the gate and up projections are exchanged.

**The load.** A missing or unexpected key must abort, because a partial load of
either checkpoint is silent and plausible. The 3B ships in two safetensors
shards named by an index, so the same refusal is tested on a release read from
several files as on one read from a single file, along with the refusal of a
release the index says is incomplete.

**The band.** The numerical tripwire is only worth its cost if it separates a
correct mapping from every corruption that survives ``strict=True`` *on the
checkpoint being scored*. The 112M and the 3B do not score anywhere near each
other, so this is a property of each declared reference rather than of one
module constant, and every declared checkpoint is held to it here. Checkable
without a GPU or the weights: the measurements themselves come from
``external_resources/baselines/progen3_eager_probe`` and from the band
measurements recorded in ``src.transfer.progen3``.

**The addressing.** ``fused_attention_norm`` moves the attention between two
places in the module tree, and the two released checkpoints disagree about it,
so which one an ablation reaches is tested on both layouts.

Nothing here loads a real checkpoint, imports the third-party ``progen3``
package, or needs a GPU; the releases it reads are ten-tensor ones it writes
itself.
